Why do you think grunge took off in Seattle as opposed to somewhere else at that time?</strong><br> A lot of it had to do with geographical isolation. Many people don&#x2019;t seem to realize that in the &#x2019;80s--before the Starbucks/Microsoft/Amazon boom era--Seattle wasn&#x2019;t the cosmopolitan place it is today. People in the rest of the country pretty much considered it the hinterlands; a couple interviewees told me that back in the day, people who weren&#x2019;t familiar with Seattle would ask them, in all sincerity, &#x201c;Seattle? Aren&#x2019;t there cowboys and Indians out there?&#x201d; Often times, touring bands would simply skip Seattle because it was too far out of their way. So, in effect, musicians in that region had to make their own fun. And in the process, they honed their own sound.</p> <p><strong>Q.) What are the biggest misconceptions people have about grunge? </strong><br> Probably the biggest one is that all these musicians were overly earnest gloom mongers sticking needles in their arms. Of course, a few were overly earnest and some were sticking needles in their arms, but for the most part--and I think this comes across in the book--these musicians were just super-funny and huge jokesters.</p> <p><strong>Q.) Where does the book&#x2019;s title come from?</strong><br> Speaking of humor in grunge... &#x201c;Everybody loves our town&#x201d; is a lyric from &#x201c;Overblown,&#x201d; an extremely arch song Mudhoney wrote for the Cameron Crowe movie <em>Singles</em>. It pretty much deflates the hype surrounding the scene at the time and takes a semi-veiled jab at at least one grunge superstar.</p> <p><strong>Q.) What&#x2019;s your favorite grunge song?</strong><br> It almost seems too obvious an answer, but Mudhoney&#x2019;s &#x201c;Touch Me I&#x2019;m Sick&#x201d; is pretty much perfect--and perfectly encapsulates the scuzzy &#x201c;grunge&#x201d; guitar sound and scabrous humor of the scene. Nirvana&#x2019;s &#x201c;Negative Creep&#x201d; comes to mind too.</p> <p><strong>Q.) Is there a grunge band that should have made it big that did not?</strong><br> Had their super-charismatic lead singer Andrew Wood not died of a drug overdose in 1990, Mother Love Bone--the band from which Pearl Jam sprung--would likely have made it big. Also, TAD--a band fronted by Tad Doyle, who was marketed as a 300-pound ex-butcher from Boise--appeared primed for success in the early &#x2019;90s. But TAD was beset by bad luck at nearly every turn. Their downward spiral began when their album <em>8-Way Santa</em> had to be yanked from shelves because the band used this hilarious, very saucy photo of a couple on the cover without their permission. (Google it.) Legend has it that the woman in the picture had since found God, and the couple took legal action.</p> <p><em>Everybody Loves Our Town: An Oral History of Grunge</em> author Mark Yarm put together this list of 15 grunge tracks (ranging from the obscure to the chart-topping) discussed in the book.</p> <p>1.

But they must make other choices before then&#x2014;decisions about purity, dating, and their roles as men and women. Are they prepared? In this highly practical guide, Joshua Mulvihill lays out a biblically grounded plan for preparing young children for later challenges. Our culture is zealous in reaching children with its own take on sex and marriage, but shouldn't we be able to talk about these things and their place in God's larger narrative? Parents, grandparents, and others in the church will learn how to bring the truth home by starting the conversation with their children early&#x2014;and returning to it often.</p><p><b>Josh Mulvihill</b> is the executive director of church and family ministry at Renewanation, which trains children to develop a biblical worldview.

Here Nouwen recounts the struggles and self-doubts he faced along this rocky road to a new vocation as he introduces us to the people of L'Arche and many others whose impact on him was deep and life-lasting.

It's time. Today is the day he will once again cast himself into the air, spiral upward into the clouds, and bank into the wind.</i></p><p>He wears a black band on his lower right leg and an orange flag on his upper left, bearing the laser inscription B95. Scientists call him the Moonbird because, in the course of his astoundingly long lifetime, this gritty, four-ounce marathoner has flown the distance to the moon&#x2015;and halfway back! </p><p>B95 is a robin-sized shorebird, a red knot of the subspecies <i>rufa. </i>Each February he joins a flock that lifts off from Tierra del Fuego, headed for breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic, nine thousand miles away. Late in the summer, he begins the return journey. </p><p>B95 can fly for days without eating or sleeping, but eventually he must descend to refuel and rest. However, recent changes at ancient refueling stations along his migratory circuit&#x2015;changes caused mostly by human activity&#x2015;have reduced the food available and made it harder for the birds to reach. And so, since 1995, when B95 was first captured and banded, the worldwide <i>rufa </i>population has collapsed by nearly 80 percent. Most perish somewhere along the great hemispheric circuit, but the Moonbird wings on. He has been seen as recently as November 2011, which makes him nearly twenty years old. Shaking their heads, scientists ask themselves: How can this one bird make it year after year when so many others fall? </p><p>National Book Award&#x2013;winning author Phillip Hoose takes us around the hemisphere with the world's most celebrated shorebird, showing the obstacles <i>rufa</i> red knots face, introducing a worldwide team of scientists and conservationists trying to save them, and offering insights about what we can do to help shorebirds before it's too late. With inspiring prose, thorough research, and stirring images, Hoose explores the tragedy of extinction through the triumph of a single bird. <i>Moonbird </i>is one <i>The Washington Post</i>'s Best Kids Books of 2012.</p><p>A Common Core Title.</p></p><p><p>Phillip Hoose is the widely-acclaimed author of the National Book Award winner <i>Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice</i>, which is also a Newbery Honor Book, a Robert F. Sibert Honor Book, a YALSA Finalist for Excellence in Young Adult Fiction, and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults, among other honors. His other books include <i>The Race to Save the Lord God Bird</i>, winner of the <i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i> Award, and <i>We Were There, Too!,</i> a National Book Award Finalist. Mr. Hoose lives in Portland, Maine.</p>Gr 6 Up-Moonbird is a nickname scientists have given to a small Eastern shorebird known for both his unusually long life and his enormously long annual migration. Hoose intertwines the story of this bird's remarkable survival with detailed accounts of the rufa red knot's physical changes through its yearlong cycle of migrating from the bottom of the world (usually Tierra del Fuego) to its Arctic breeding grounds and back again at summer's end-a round trip of some 18,000 miles. Moonbird, known usually by the identifying label "B95" on his orange leg band, was first banded in 1995, when it was thought that he was at least three years old, and Hoose notes sightings of him through early 2011 just as the book was reaching completion. At that point it was estimated that over 20 years' time, B95 had flown "more than 325,000 miles in his life-the distance to the moon and nearly halfway back." The feat is particularly celebrated among bird scientists because this species is rapidly declining as humans use and misuse its feeding grounds and food supply. The threatened state of the species and the personal work being done by scientists and conservationists are strong themes throughout the book. Hoose describes his own experiences participating in study trips and introduces children and teens engaged in study, conservation, and lobbying projects in Canada, the United States, and Argentina. This deeply researched, engaging account is a substantial and well-designed package of information illustrated with handsome color photographs, ample maps, appended descriptions of the conservation work, and thorough source notes.-Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Rather than fight the tide, he embraced the nickname and reissued the book. <i>How We Live</i> is a fascinating examination of the machinery of life. Dr. Nuland begins his meditation with a hair-raising account of a medical emergency that nearly ends in disaster: a 40-year-old woman almost bleeds to death on the operating table as he and other doctors struggle frantically to find the source of the hemorrhage. Eventually, Dr. Nuland and his team are able to locate the cause--a rare aneurysm of the splenic artery--and repair it. The patient survives. <i>How We Live</i>, Dr. Nuland tells us, grew out of the experiences of that night and his certainty that Marge Hanson lived because of her own will and the surgical team's will not to let her die. That "will to live" is what Dr. Nuland calls the Human Spirit, and spirit is very much a part of the body's wisdom. <p>Each chapter of <i>How We Live</i> focuses on a different biological function, from the work of the lymph nodes to the process of pregnancy and birth. The heart, the nervous and digestive systems, the sex organs, and the brain are all explored and commented on with clarity and grace. But Dr. Nuland is not content with merely providing an operating manual for the body. He is in a constant state of wonder at what a miraculous and mysterious thing the body is: a dynamic system of parts all working in concert, infused with that fierce, intangible quality--the human spirit.</p>"An anatomy of human life, vividly illustrated. . . .

The only witness to the murder is Ivy, her six-year-old daughter, who points to her mom's boyfriend-father of the unborn child. County prosecutor Madeleine Thompson promises the community justice, and in the Ozarks, that can only mean one thing: a death sentence.<br><br>When Madeleine's first choice for co-counsel declines to try a death penalty case, she is forced to turn to assistant prosecutor Elsie Arnold. Elsie is reluctant to join forces with her frosty boss, but the road to conviction seems smooth-until unexpected facts about the victim arise, and the testimony of the lone eyewitness Ivy becomes increasingly crucial. Against Elsie's advice, Madeleine brings in the state attorney general's office to assist them, while cutthroat trial attorney Claire O'Hara joins the defense.<br><br>Elsie will not let the power of prosecution-of seeking justice-be wrested from her without a fight. She wants to win the case, and to avenge the death of the mother and her unborn child. But as the trial nears, Elsie begins to harbor doubts about the death penalty itself.

In <i>The Inner Voice</i>&#x2014;a book that is the story of her own artistic development and the &#x201c;autobiography&#x201d; of her voice&#x2014;this great performer presents a unique and privileged look at the making of a singer and offers hard-won, practical advice to aspiring performance artists everywhere. From her youth as the child of two singing teachers through her years at Juilliard, from her struggles to establish her career to her international success, <i>The Inner Voice</i> is a luminous, articulate, and candid self-portrait of a contemporary artist&#x2014;and the most revelatory examination yet of the performing life.</p><p><b>From Publishers Weekly</b> Calling this candid account "the autobiography of my voice," soprano Fleming details the years of study it took to master the art of vocal production and the discipline that brought her international renown. A former manager deemed her "the single most ambitious singer he has ever known," and given the tenacity with which she faced early setbacks&#x2014;"I have a noble history of being rejected from a lot of places," she writes&#x2014;his comment is understandable. After her first big break in 1990 (as the Countess in Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro with the Houston Grand Opera), Fleming's rise to the top was steady. But she's quick to point out that the life of an opera star is not always glitter and glamour; the business side of singing&#x2014;scheduling performances, arranging interviews and recordings, choosing a repertoire and marketing herself&#x2014;is arduous. Although Fleming offers glimpses into her personal life, touching on her failed marriage and her loving relationship with her two daughters and concluding with a chapter describing what she experiences backstage during a Metropolitan Opera production, this is not a deeply intimate autobiography full of childhood vignettes, personal anecdotes and behind-the-curtains gossip. Instead, it's a realistic portrait of what it takes to succeed and a volume intriguing for its advice and honesty. Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The last serious study was published more than six decades ago. Since then other accounts have appeared, but none are deeply researched full-length studies of the raid and its more than substantial (and yet often overlooked) results. The publication of Timothy B. Smith&#x2019;s The Real Horse Soldiers: Benjamin Grierson&#x2019;s Epic 1863 Civil War Raid through Mississippi, now available in paperback, rectifies this oversight.<br><br>There were other simultaneous operations to distract Confederate attention from the real threat posed by General U. S. Grant&#x2019;s Army of the Tennessee across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg in Louisiana. Grierson&#x2019;s operation, however, conducted with three cavalry regiments and a battery of small artillery pieces, is the most famous. For 16 days (April 17 to May 2), Grierson led Confederate pursuers on a high-stakes chase through the entire state of Mississippi, entering through the northern border with Tennessee and exiting its southern border with Louisiana. The daily rides were long, the rest stops short, and the danger as high as the tension. Ironically, the man who led the raid was a former music teacher who some say disliked horses. Throughout, he displayed outstanding leadership and cunning, destroyed railroad tracks and supplies, burned trestles and bridges, freed slaves, and created as much damage and chaos as possible.<br><br>Novelists have attempted to capture the larger-than-life cavalry raid in the popular imagination, and Hollywood reproduced the daring cavalry action in The Horse Soldiers, a 1959 major motion picture starring John Wayne and William Holden. Readers of The Real Horse Soldiers who think they know all about this cavalry operation will quickly discover just how complex and important it was, and how close it came to abject failure.<br><br>Based upon years of research and presented in gripping, fast-paced prose, Timothy B. Smith&#x2019;s award-winning The Real Horse Soldiers captures the high drama and tension of the 1863 horse soldiers in a modern comprehensive study.</p><p>Timothy B.

In addition to many articles and essays, he is the author, editor, or co-editor of eighteen books, including Champion Hill: Decisive Battle for Vicksburg (2004), which won the nonfiction book award from the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters, Corinth 1862: Siege, Battle, Occupation (2012), which won the Fletcher Pratt Award and the McLemore Prize, Shiloh: Conquer or Perish (2014), which won the Richard B.

This epic account is as thrilling and fast-paced as the raid itself and will quickly rival, if not surpass, D. Brown&#x2019;s Grierson&#x2019;s Raid as the standard work on what William T.

Grant proved he was the master of the strategic cavalry raid by launching Col. Benjamin Grierson&#x2019;s spring 1863 cavalry ride through the heart of Confederate Mississippi. The bold and exciting raid created so much havoc within Southern command circles that Grant was able to sneak across the Mississippi River against minimal opposition, dooming Vicksburg.

NYU Professor Michael Rectenwald - the notorious @AntiPCNYUProf - illuminates the obscurity of postmodern theory to track down the ideas and beliefs that spawned the contemporary social justice creed and movement. In fast-paced creative non-fiction, Rectenwald begins by recounting how his Twitter capers and media exposure met with the swift and punitive response of NYU administrators and fellow faculty members. The author explains his evolving political perspective and his growing consternation with social justice developments while panning the treatment he received from academic colleagues and the political left.</p> <p>The memoir is the story of an education, a debriefing, as well as an entertaining and sometimes humorous romp through academia and a few corners of the author s personal life. The memoir includes early autobiographical material to provide context for Rectenwald s academic, political, and personal development and even surprises with an account of his apprenticeship, at age nineteen, with the poet Allen Ginsberg.</p> <p>Unlike many examinations of postmodern theory, <em>Springtime for Snowflakes</em> is a first-person, insider narrative. Likening his testimony to that of an anthropologist who has gone native and returned, the author recalls his graduate education in English departments and his academic career thereafter. In his graduate studies in English and Literary and Cultural Theory/Studies, the author explains, he absorbed the tenets of Marxism, the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory, as well as various esoteric postmodern theories. He connects ideas gleaned there to manifestations in social justice to explain the otherwise inexplicable beliefs and rituals of this religious creed. Altogether, the narrative works to demystify social justice as well as Rectenwald s revolt against it.</p> <p>Proponents of contemporary social justice will find much to hate and opponents much to love in this uncompromising indictment. But social justice advocates should not dismiss this enlightening look into the background of social justice and one of its fiercest critics. This short testimonial could very well convince some to reconsider their approach.

They invest their energies into dead-end ideologies. An escape doesn t usually happen without a crisis developing. For intellectuals, just like ordinary folks, much of life is fortuitous.

Those who just attack its author over it (whether or not they've actually read it) will thereby reconfirm his point: that 'social justice,' as now preached and practiced on most campuses (and not just there) in the United States, is not a legacy of earlier mass movements for (real) social justice, but a religious creed with an effectively totalitarian agenda, birthed in the vast hothouse of postmodern theory. Here's hoping that this book will start real arguments, whether they elaborate its thesis, or modify it, or whatever else it takes to drive the counter-movement that all of us so very badly need. </p> <p><strong>Mark Crispin Miller</strong>, NYU Professor of Media, Culture &amp; Communication.

In it, we see a picture of early Christians wrestling to apply the teachings of Jesus to their everyday lives. And we see a community plagued by divisiveness and hypocrisy, with an emphasis on wealth and status. James pulls no punches addressing these issues, calling for a faith that shows itself in moral actions: in speech, in interpersonal relationships, in economic and social justice. He also lays out a theology of the redemptive value of suffering.In our day when the behavior and attitudes of professed Christians are often not much different from the surrounding culture, in our society of great wealth, and in our culture that abhors suffering, the challenging message of James is greatly needed. Exploring the links between the Bible and our own times, David Nystrom shares perspectives on the book of James that reveal its enduring relevance for our twenty-first-century lives.This series promises to become an indispensable tool for every pastor and teacher who seeks to make the Bible's timeless message speak to this generation.Billy GrahamThe NIV Application Commentary dares to go where few scholars have gone before&#x2015;into the real world of biblical application faced by pastors and teachers every day.

But biblical figures such as Moses, Aaron, and Pinchas disobey God and are praised or rewarded for it.</li> <li>People say Abraham was praised because of his willingness to sacrifice his only son on an altar. But Abraham never decides he will sacrifice Isaac. He believes God will back down, and the Bible tells us so explicitly.</li> <li>People say that the biblical heroes are mostly men. But the Bible goes out of its way to emphasize that no fewer than five different women risked their lives in the struggle to save the infant Moses, suggesting that without every one of these women the Jews would never have left Egypt.</li> <li>People say the Bible is about faith as the ultimate value. But the law of Moses includes no commandment to have faith, and the Bible tells us that Moses himself was unable to attain a perfect faith in God.</li> <li>People say that God calls himself &#x201c;I am that I am&#x201d; at the burning bush, implying (as tradition has it) that he is perfect being, eternal and unchanging. But the original text actually says the opposite of this: In Hebrew God says &#x201c;I will be what I will be,&#x201d; suggested that God is not perfect but rather imperfect and changing.</li> <li>People say that the biblical kingdom of the Israelites was destroyed because it turned to idolatry. But the fall of the kingdom begins with Solomon, his inability to control his desire for big armies, women, and gold, and the ruinous taxation and enslavement of his people that result from this.</li> <li>People say the story of Cain and Abel is about hatred between brothers. But Cain and Abel aren&#x2019;t just any brothers. They stand for conflicting ways of life&#x2014;the life of the farmer vs. that of the shepherd. Abel is just the first in a line of biblical heroes (including Abraham, Jacob, Moses and David, and more) whom choose the life of the shepherd and what it represents and so win God&#x2019;s love.</li> </ul> <p><b>An Interview with Yoram Hazony</b></p> <p><b>Yoram, why did you write The Philosophy of Hebrew Scripture?</b></p> <p>Hebrew Scripture is an intensely personal subject for me. In some ways, I feel a very deep sympathy for biblical figures like Jeremiah and Ezekiel. These are people who saw the destruction of their nation with their own eyes&#x2014;something that we can hardly even imagine. The Hebrew Bible is the record they left us of what this unimaginable catastrophe, and of the lessons they thought future generations should learn from it.</p> <p>I think that when someone leaves you a record like that, it&#x2019;s a very special thing. These people sent us, you could say, a message in a bottle, telling us what happened to them. This bottle contains all their most intimate suffering, but also their reflections and ideas&#x2014;ideas they thought we&#x2019;d need so that we&#x2019;d remember and not make the same mistakes ourselves. But today for all sorts of reasons we ignore that message. For most people the Bible is just a closed book.</p> <p>And this is something I find very painful. I put myself in their place and think: How would they feel knowing that we today receive that message in a bottle&#x2014;that we hold it in our hands&#x2014;and say to ourselves: What these people had to say is just not something I&#x2019;m interested in taking seriously. We turn our back on them. We&#x2019;re deaf to their cry.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s been about twenty-five years now since I first understood that this is what was happening. I almost feel that I owe it to them, to the people who put that message in a bottle after what was really something like a Shoah for them, like the end of the world for them. I want to help people be able to hear their voices again. That&#x2019;s how I came to this.</p> <p><b>So you almost have a sense of mission about this&#x2014;about bringing the Hebrew Bible to a place of respect among people who find it difficult to appreciate its power and importance today?</b></p> <p>That&#x2019;s exactly right. I do feel that. I&#x2019;ve found that people who can bring the Bible to life for modern educated people are surprisingly rare. It&#x2019;s something it turns out I can do well. I speak before audiences about the Bible and they sometimes sit for hours asking me to tell them another Bible story and then another so that they feel they make sense, maybe for the first time. If that&#x2019;s what people want me to do, I feel I don&#x2019;t have a right to turn that down. It&#x2019;s really a kind of a calling.</p> <p><b>When did you begin to feel this way?</b></p> <p>It happened in graduate school. I went back to graduate school to study political thought and philosophy&#x2014;subjects I&#x2019;m embarrassed to say that I simply missed as an undergraduate. So there I was in a Ph.D. program studying Plato and Hobbes and Nietzsche for the first time in a serious way. I loved the subject and I loved my instructors.</p> <p>But almost from the first moment I kept having this feeling as I was reading these books: Well this sounds just like Hebrew Scripture! It&#x2019;s dealing with the same questions&#x2014;sometimes giving similar answers and sometimes different ones. But the biblical answers are as good as the ones we find in the other big books of the Western tradition. So why isn&#x2019;t the Bible part of the story? Why do we study the great books of the West but exclude the Bible?</p> <p>I asked my instructors about this and they were actually extremely supportive. They told me that I might be right to feel uncomfortable, and encouraged me to write my doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of the book of Jeremiah, which I finished in 1993. I think it was one of the first dissertations on a subject like that, although since then there have been many others. Parts of that dissertation are appearing in published form for the first time in this new book The Philosophy of Hebrew Scripture.</p> <p><b>Do you think it matters much whether university programs teach Bible as part of what they study? Aren&#x2019;t the universities detached from what most people think?</b></p> <p>Yes, I think it matters immensely. People think of the universities as an &#x201c;ivory tower&#x201d; disconnected from the normal lives that regular people lead. But this is a mistake. The universities play a very important role in modern society: They define the range of legitimate belief on almost every subject they deal with. If the universities decide that dinosaurs were warm-blooded and hopped like birds, then all the dinosaur books we had when we were kids get thrown out and replaced by new ones. And if the universities decide that most of the universe is made of dark matter that can&#x2019;t be detected by any instrument, then this is what most people think you should probably believe, even if ten years earlier people would have said that was ridiculous.</p> <p>The same is true for the Bible. If the basic view that&#x2019;s accepted in universities is that what&#x2019;s in the Hebrew Bible just isn&#x2019;t worth taking seriously&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s not worthy of being studied sympathetically and with respect like other classic works of philosophy or political thought, then that&#x2019;s pretty much what educated everywhere are going to end up thinking.</p> <p>Then it ends up being the case that the schools don&#x2019;t really teach Bible and it&#x2019;s not really the subject of discussion in any other cultural setting either. The view of the professors ends up being a kind of semi-official opinion that&#x2019;s accepted throughout society. Of course there are religious folks who think the Bible is worth reading&#x2014;but they end up being seen as oddballs for it. There&#x2019;s just this feeling that you can&#x2019;t be really impressed and exciting by the teachings of Hebrew Scripture and still be a reasonable person.</p> <p><b>And you&#x2019;d like to see a change in that?</b></p> <p>I think it&#x2019;s desperately needed.</p> <p><b>Why?</b></p> <p>You know, I can&#x2019;t say it better than this young woman I met at an airport in the UK last year. I was on my way to Scotland and she was coming from Ireland and on her way to Israel&#x2014;she was getting onto a plane I had just gotten off of. It was her second trip. She told me her husband hadn&#x2019;t wanted to go so she was going alone. I asked her why it was so important for her to go, since she wasn&#x2019;t a Jew. She said to me: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t explain exactly. But I know that going back to the Bible is going back to the root of everything. It&#x2019;s who we are.&#x201d;</p> <p>I think this young Irishwoman had it right: The Hebrew Bible is who we are, and what we are.</p> <p>People who don&#x2019;t know how to approach the biblical texts simply don&#x2019;t realize the degree to which what is written in them defines us: What we think about and how we think about it. A lot of things we believe are modern are actually biblical in the most obvious sense&#x2014;but if you don&#x2019;t know the Bible then you think it was made up by someone recent.</p> <p>I think this disconnection of modern people from everything having to do with their roots is difficult on the individual level and might even be dangerous on the level of nations. When you&#x2019;re cut off from your roots you often come to feel an ache and an emptiness that you can&#x2019;t explain. And often enough that vacant space ends up getting filled with all sorts of crazy things, with fascism and communism being just two obvious examples of what the world looks like after all the roots have been torn out.</p> <p><b>But isn&#x2019;t that a process that&#x2019;s already very far gone. Is there really any hope of going back?</b></p> <p>I really don&#x2019;t know. I look at the way the European nations are tearing up and discarding everything they once were, and I do wonder. Countries like Holland and Britain were nations formed by the Bible&#x2014;and especially by the &#x201c;Old Testament&#x201d; part of the Christian Bible. But then I meet people like this woman from Ireland, and it makes me think maybe something could change.</p>What if the Bible wasn&#39;t meant to be read as &#34;revelation&#34;? The Philosophy of Hebrew Scripture proposes a new framework for reading the Bible, transforming forever our understanding of what the stories of Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, and David, and the speeches of Isaiah and Jeremiah, were meant to teach.</p><h2>Counseling Addicted Families: A Sequential Assessment and Treatment Model</h2><p><p></p> <p><em>Counseling Addicted Families</em>, Second Edition,&nbsp;is an up-to-date treatment manual that fosters lasting change for families dealing with addiction and addictive disorders.</p> <p>Focused around the clinically esteemed Sequential Family Addictions Model, the book guides counselors through the principles of how to "progressively sequence" a client family during their change process, and explores how family counseling theories and interventions can be applied in treatment settings.

How we engage in our small-group communication in each medium matters. To be effective we have to consider our group roles, norms, cohesion, process, and phases of development, as well as our personal verbal and nonverbal communication and listening styles. To succeed as a member of a team, we need to consider the limits of our personal experience and perspective, recognize the creative strength of diverse perspectives in decision making and problem solving, develop our conflict-management skills, and strengthen our leadership skills. To be successful necessitates an understanding of group process, participation style, ethical group behavior, and the influences of the medium.<p> <i>Small Group and Team Communication</i> explores all these different interconnections and the communication strategies we use in our work and social groups. The authors use the systems perspective as their core approach throughout the text, treating small groups as complex open systems reliant upon communication to achieve success. Many chapters highlight the importance of considering ethics and diversity in relation to a variety of topics. Harris and Sherblom address the growing influence of computer-mediated communication to this discipline. Real-world, applied examples show students that what they're learning aren't simply abstract concepts, but knowledge that will serve them outside the classroom.</p><p> Not-for-sale instructor resource material available to college and university faculty only; contact publisher directly.</p><p> Title of related interest also available from Waveland Press: Young et al., <i>Group Discussion: A Practical Guide to Participation and Leadership,</i> Fourth Edition (ISBN 9781577664758).</p></p><p></p><h2>Plumbing Design and Installation Workbook</h2><p><p><br>The workbook presents review and test material to<br>support the content presented in <i>Plumbing Design and Installation</i> textbook.</p></p><p></p><h2>Oral Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist</h2><p><p> <i>Oral Pharmacology for the Dental Hygienist, Second Edition,</i> offers a comprehensive review of the principles of pharmacology and their application to dental hygiene practice.

He was a witty and iconoclastic mathematician and computer scientist whose work and influence still reverberates through the areas he was interested in and passionate about.

As you read this book, you will learn how the Lord used some people to plant the seeds of church reform long before October 31, 1517, when Martin Luther published his ninety-five theses. Luther's story is well-known; we trust you will find it interesting and instructive to read about him and about forty others (John Knox, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Zacharias Ursinus, Willem Teellinck, etc.) who contributed to the Reformation - some well known and others not so - most of whom are Reformation heroes. <p> To provide a more full picture of the many sided Reformation, chapters are also included on the Anabaptist and Counter Reformation movements.

The term bisexual functions as a useful shorthand for a broad spectrum of sexualities: as the editors note in the Introduction, some contributors self-identify as queer, pansexual, omnisexual, or labelless, while others acknowlege attractions to multiple genders while identifying as lesbian, gay, or heterosexual. This complexity infuses the book at every level, as writers differ not only in their definitions of bisexuality, but also in their politics, spiritualities, sexual practices, and patterns of daily life. The essayists include accomplished writers and bi activists such as Loraine Hutchins, Lani Ka'ahumanu, Carol Queen, and Amanda Udis-Kessler, as well as literary unknowns, many of whom are published here for the first time. Most of the essays are conversational in tone and personal in content, as the writers discuss coming out, the choice to identify (or not) as bisexual, life experiences, sexual desire, bi community, and political activism. <p> Many anthologies aspire to be international in scope, but few achieve that vision. Getting Bi is a rare success in this respect, as the book includes voices from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Columbia, Cuba, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela and Zimbabwe, and more. This diversity of location and perspective makes Getting Bi useful in college or high school courses that center global and/or transnational analyses of feminism and/or sexuality. The lively and engaging content continues and extends the best traditions of <b>Bi Any Other Name</b>, while the international scope and glorious polyphony mark the beginning of a new era in bi literature. <b>Getting Bi</b> is an astounding achievement. --Robin Bernstein, Assistant Professor of Women, Gender &amp; Sexuality, Harvard University<br><br>This book is amazing! It is certainly the most <i>international</i> international anthology I've ever read. Rather than interpreting other people's experiences, the editors created a well-designed and organized anthology of a wide range of people describing their lives and experiences in their own words. There are 220 essays, from 42 different countries, written by teenagers, grandparents and everyone in between. In essays and in poems, authors talk about coming out, tell their life stories, discuss bi community, relationships, politics, and desire. Each contribution is accompanied by a short author bio, and most have photos. This book literally puts a face on bisexual identity. I recommend it to people of all sexual orientations -- to those who identify as bisexual, and to those who don't. A rich and rewarding reading experience and a great resource. --Gail Zacharias, Boston, MA<br><br><b>Getting Bi</b> is one of the most important recent contributions to the global struggle for human rights. By enriching our understanding of bisexuality within so many cultural and geographic contexts, this anthology serves as a magnificent tool for building support and respect for the sexual rights of each one of us. --Paula Ettelbrick, Executive Director of the International Gay &amp; Lesbian Human Rights Commission.</p></p><h2>Patisserie: A Masterclass in Classic and Contemporary Patisserie</h2><p><p><b>'A profoundly pleasurable book which offers that rare combination of daring, accomplished technique illuminated with extraordinary simplicity and clarity.&nbsp;His latest must-have book will inspire and delight.'

Where Emily lived, in the heart of New York City, the storm was at its worst. Sitting alone in the apartment she shared with her policeman father, she never imagined that a simple thunderstorm could be this bad.<br> <br>She clutched her cell phone and felt guilty for lying to her father. He&#x2019;d just called to check on her.<br> <br>&#x201c;All the police have been summoned into work, honey,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing double and triple shifts. The city&#x2019;s a madhouse because of the weather, and they need everyone on duty. Do me a favor, will you? Keep away from the windows. There are lightning strikes all over the city, and our top-floor apartment is at particular risk.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yet, despite his warning and her promise to keep away, Emily sat in the large window seat and watched the raging storm. This had always been her mother&#x2019;s favorite spot. She used to call it her &#x201c;perch&#x201d;: her special place to sit and watch the world moving around twenty stories below. Since her mother&#x2019;s death, Emily found herself sitting there more and more often, as though it could somehow bring her closer to her mother.<br> <br>But not only that; from this vantage point Emily could see the top of the Empire State Building. Her father had once told her that the building itself worked as a giant lightning rod to protect the other buildings around it. But as more and more forked lightning struck its tall antenna, she wondered how much more it could take.<br> <br>Emily hugged her knees to her chest to keep from trembling. She&#x2019;d never been frightened of thunder when her mother was alive. Somehow they&#x2019;d always found ways of making foul weather fun and exciting. But now, all alone with her father at work, Emily felt her mother&#x2019;s loss as acutely as the day she died.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish you were here, Mom,&#x201d; she whispered sadly as she gazed out the window. Emily&#x2019;s eyes filled with tears that trickled down her cheeks.<br> <br>Suddenly there was an ever-louder peal of thunder and brilliant flash of lightning. It struck the Empire State so hard, the antenna at the top of the building exploded in a flash of electrical sparks and flying debris.<br> <br>Emily could hardly believe what she had just witnessed. She wiped the tears from her blurred eyes as all the lights in the tall building blinked out. Immediately after, the lights in buildings around it went out. The darkness spread like a grape-juice stain on the carpet, as the city was hit with a blackout.<br> <br>Emily followed the progression of the blackout as she peered up Broadway. Block after block was going dark. Even the street- and traffic lights were out. It wasn&#x2019;t long before the power outage reached her block, plunging her apartment building into darkness. She leaned farther against the glass and tried to see where the blackout ended. It didn&#x2019;t. The whole city was in darkness.<br> <br>She jumped as her cell burst to life. With trembling hands, she flipped it open and read her father&#x2019;s name on the small view screen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe what just happened! The top of the Empire State just blew up! Lightning hit it and it exploded. Pieces went flying everywhere!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I just heard,&#x201d; her father said anxiously. &#x201c;Are you all right? Did anything hit our building?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; Emily replied, trying to hide the fact that she was far from fine. She was actually starting to get very frightened. &#x201c;But the power&#x2019;s gone out. From what I can see, it&#x2019;s dark all over the city.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily heard another voice in the background. Her father cursed before speaking to her again.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting reports that the blackout has spread to all the boroughs and is hitting New Jersey. This is a big one, Em. And from what I&#x2019;ve just been told, it&#x2019;s not going to be fixed anytime soon. I need you to go into the bathroom and fill the tub with water. Then fill whatever you can in the kitchen. We don&#x2019;t know how long this is going to last, and we&#x2019;ll need that water.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; she promised. Then, before she could stop herself, Emily asked weakly, &#x201c;Dad, when are you coming home?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, honey,&#x201d; he answered. &#x201c;Hopefully soon. Look, do you want me to call Aunt Maureen and ask her to come over and stay with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily loved her aunt, but she didn&#x2019;t want to sound like a baby. She was old enough to take care of herself. &#x201c;No thanks, Dad, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; her father asked. &#x201c;I bet she could use the company.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;The storm&#x2019;s just got me a bit freaked. But I&#x2019;ve got lots to do here. Besides, it&#x2019;s too dangerous for Maureen to come over in all this and then have to climb twenty flights of stairs. Really, I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a hesitation in her father&#x2019;s voice before he said, &#x201c;All right. But if you need me or anything at all, I&#x2019;m just a phone call away. Understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do. Thanks, Dad,&#x201d; Emily said. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;d better go before the water shuts down.&#x201d;<br> <br>Emily ended the call and used the light from her cell-phone screen to guide her into the kitchen. She quickly found the emergency flashlight and crossed to the bathroom.<br> <br>This was the standard operating procedure for blackouts. Fill the bathtub and every other container with water. One of the downsides of living in a tall building during a blackout was the pumps sending water up to the apartments soon stopped. If they didn&#x2019;t store all the water they could, they would quickly find themselves in a lot of trouble.<br> <br>She began to fill the bathtub, and then the pots and pans in the kitchen. Just as she finished filling the last big soup pot, the pressure behind the water flow started to weaken. It wouldn&#x2019;t be long before it stopped completely.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s better than nothing,&#x201d; she sighed aloud as she shut off all the faucets.<br> <br>While she worked, Emily had managed to forget about the storm for a few minutes. But with the water off, the sound of the rumbling thunder and police and fire sirens from the city were the only sounds in the apartment.<br> <br>Just outside the bathroom window, Emily saw another burst of lightning and heard more thunder. The lightning was so bright it left her seeing flashes, even after she closed her eyes. There was no pause between the light and sound, which meant this latest strike was very close.<br> <br>As the thunder rumbled angrily, Emily moved away from the window. This time she would follow her father&#x2019;s advice and stay well clear of all the windows. The storm was directly overhead&#x2014;and getting worse by the minute.</p><h2>Addicted to Busy: Recovery for the Rushed Soul</h2><p>We are all spread too thin, taking on more than we can handle, trying to do so much&#x2014;almost as if we are afraid that if we were to take a moment of rest, we might discover that all our busyness is covering up an essential lack in our lives.<br><br>But God never meant for us to be so busy.

And yet concepts like "gay" or "straight" are relatively recent developments in human history. We let ourselves be defined by socially constructed notions of sexual identity and sexual orientation--even though these may not be the only or best ways to think about sexuality. Anthropologist Jenell Williams Paris offers a Christian framework for sexual holiness that accounts for complex postmodern realities. She assesses problems with popular cultural and Christian understandings of heterosexuality and homosexuality alike. <em>The End of Sexual Identity</em> moves beyond culture-war impasses to open up new space for conversations in diverse communities both inside and outside the church.</p><p><strong>Jenell Williams Paris</strong> (Ph.D., American University) is professor of anthropology at Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. She has written for such publications as <em>Christianity Today, Books Culture</em> and <em>Christian Scholar's Review.</em> Her books include <em>Birth Control for Christians, Urban Disciples</em> and <em>Introducing Cultural Anthropology: A Christian Perspective.</em>With an ironic smile, <em>The End of Sexual Identity</em> attempts to perform reparative therapy on the church, so that she will convert from her cultural orientation back to the biblical one where humans are regarded as just humans-not reduced to their sexual deeds and desires. Paris shows that the sexual identity framework was not dropped on earth by some divine skyhook; we're better off without this newfangled invention. Hers is a prophetic call for the church to <i>get over</i> its heterosexist moral superiority and <i>get on</i> with its business of shepherding all persons toward sexual holiness. (Christopher Benson, Christianity Today Online, July 2012)<br><br>"This is a great book . . . Paris uses world history, culture, story, Scripture, thorough research and personal opinion to educate and challenge us to grow in our biblical worldview on sexuality, our compassion for individual differences and struggles, and encourages us to cease using what she calls a "sexual identity framework" to define who we are. She does all this and yet calls us to sexual holiness and repentance. I do hope you will read it!" (Kent Miller, YouthWorker Journal, May/June 2011)<br><br>"God gave us genitals, but he didn't stop there. He made us human. What does that mean? And what is love of neighbor? What is a welcoming church? What are strengths of celibacy when supported by Christian community? Not just scholarly but also painfully and hilariously personal, this book shatters stereotypes for the sake of the kingdom." (Miriam Adeney, professor, Seattle Pacific University, and author of Kingdom Without Borders)<br><br>"Jenell Paris has produced a provocative and astute diagnosis of our situation in the US: living in 'an oversexualized culture with an undersexualized spirituality.' She refuses to argue in broad generalizations and to remain content with the polarized categories that Christian reflections on sex and sexuality so often produce. As a Christian cultural anthropologist she digs below the surface and brings a sophisticated interpretation of the cultural complexity of our sexual lives. Her most piercing contribution is in challenging the 'sexual identity framework' itself that traps both Christian and non-Christian reflection on sexuality. She exposes just how paralyzed Christians become by the categories borrowed from the cultural waters we swim in, particularly the socially constructed and historically recent categories of 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual.' As someone who describes herself as a 'sex only within marriage between a man and a woman' kind of Christian, Dr. Paris's insights will surprise and challenge readers from seemingly incompatible perspectives on these issues. She is consistently gracious, but definitely not <em>nice."</em> (Jamie Gates, M.Div., Ph.D., cultural anthropologist and director of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation at Point Loma Nazarene University)<br><br>"I love Jenell Williams Paris's suggestion that we not stuff anyone into any identity box other than the one for those Jesus calls beloved. It's exceedingly hard to say a fresh word on these matters. Paris has done so with wisdom and gentleness." (Jason Byassee, executive director of leadership education, Duke Divinity School)<br><br>"<em>The End of Sexual Identity</em> is a brilliant, bold, personal and biblically grounded work that is destined to become a classic in its field. By exposing the culturally conditioned nature of our modern Western 'sexual identity framework,' Paris completely reframes Christian debates about sexual ethics and thereby helps us (finally!) move effectively in our understanding of what it means to pursue sexual holiness. As a pastor, I have to confess that this is the most helpful, paradigm-changing and stimulating book on this topic I've ever read. I couldn't recommend it more strongly!" (Greg Boyd, senior pastor, Woodland Hills Church)<br><br>"This is a singularly important book, about sexuality but also about culture, and it is a model of charity, clarity and creativity. While this is certainly not the last word on Christian sexual ethics, it could be the first word of a better and more honest conversation about holiness and faithfulness amidst our age's sexual confusion." (Andy Crouch, author of Culture Making: Recovering Our Creative Calling)<br><br>"Jenell Paris does us a great favor by reminding us that God didn't create heterosexuals or homosexuals. People did, and fairly recently, in fact. Paris reveals the church's cultural captivity to Western ideas of sexual identity and orientation--that what we want, sexually speaking, is who we are. Humbug. Paris challenges the church with the words of Paul: don't be captive to the patterns of this world. Both heterosexuality and homosexuality--and the panoply of other possible identities and acronyms--are social constructions that pose problems for a people whose identity is to be found in Christ. Instead, Paris reminds us that God has redeemed us, called us by name and claimed us as his own. That is an identity worth affirming. Paris challenges us to live beyond sexual identity, even as we pursue sexual holiness, and provides us with a vision for what a post-sexual-identity church might look like. This is a rich book, one that is long overdue. It is theologically sound, has deep ramifications for the church and will rattle some quarters. Good." (Mark D. Regnerus, professor of sociology, University of Texas, and author of Forbidden Fruit and Premarital Sex in America)<br><br>"Jenell Williams Paris brings a fresh perspective to the subject of sexual identity as she reminds us that we are all just people and far from perfect, 'each of whom is lover and loved.' She invites us to extend and receive grace even as she boldly encourages us to think a bit differently than we might about sexuality. I highly recommend it." (Lisa Graham McMinn, Ph.D., professor of sociology and author of Sexuality and Holy Longing)<br><br>"Honest. Smart. Provocative. Helpful. Important. Pitch-perfect. These are only a few of the words that came to mind when I read Jenell Williams Paris's book <em>The End of Sexual Identity.</em> This book is a must-read for engaging the issue of sexuality in our world today. Not only does Jenell call us to a better way to engage with sexuality, she casts a beautiful vision of what sexual wholeness and a post-sexual identity church can be."

We walk on it, drive on it, and many of us live and work within its walls. But very few of us know what it is. We take for granted this ubiquitous substance, which both literally and figuratively comprises much of modern civilization&#39;s constructed environment; yet the story of its creation and development features a cast of fascinating characters and remarkable historical episodes. This book delves into this history, opening readers&#39; eyes at every turn.In a lively narrative peppered with intriguing details, author Robert Corland describes how some of the most famous personalities of history became involved in the development and use of concrete-including King Herod the Great of Judea, the Roman emperor Hadrian, Thomas Edison (who once owned the largest concrete cement plant in the world), and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Courland points to recent archaeological evidence suggesting that the discovery of concrete directly led to the Neolithic Revolution and the rise of the earliest civilizations. Much later, the Romans reached extraordinarily high standards for concrete production, showcasing their achievement in iconic buildings like the Coliseum and the Pantheon. Amazingly, with the fall of the Roman Empire, the secrets of concrete manufacturing were lost for over a millennium. The author explains that when concrete was rediscovered in the late eighteenth century it was initially viewed as an interesting novelty or, at best, a specialized building material suitable only for a narrow range of applications. It was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that the use of concrete exploded. During this rapid expansion, industry lobbyists tried to disguise the fact that modern concrete had certain defects and critical shortcomings. It is now recognized that modern concrete, unlike its Roman predecessor, gradually disintegrates with age. Compounding this problem is another distressing fact: the manufacture of concrete cement is a major contributor to global warming. Concrete Planet is filled with incredible stories, fascinating characters, surprising facts, and an array of intriguing insights into the building material that forms the basis of the infrastructure on which we depend.</p><p><b>Robert Courland</b> is the author of <i>The Old North Waterfront</i>, which won a special-achievement award from the California Heritage Council, and, with Walt Crowley, <i>The Fairmont Hotel: The First Century of a San Francisco Landmark.</i> He has also written magazine articles, television commercials, and screenplays."The history of concrete construction is an unlikely subject for a popular book, but Robert Courland&#x2019;s Concrete Planet engages the reader like a who done it novel. Courland easily and seamlessly covers the science, technology, craft, and architectural expression in the invention and use of concrete with precision and lively prose, describing both the best and the worst examples of its use over the ages and in the present. He successfully manages to bring more than two thousand years of human history alive using concrete as the thread, while delving deep enough to reveal the intimate details of the business and family lives of its famous, and sometimes infamous, inventors, designers, and builders across the Western world."<br>Randolph Langenbach, former senior analyst in response and recovery at FEMA, author of Don&#x2019;t Tear It Down!<br><br>"A delightful excursion through time and across continents!"<br>Dr. Robert Nason, author and former USGS seismologist <br><br>"Concrete Planet is an unimaginably poetic and nuanced look at the most common substance on earth, a lumpen and lifeless mass that has been molded into a thing of sculpted beauty, turned our horizontal society into a vertical one, and will serve as our visual legacy long after we are gone.

Scholars at the great German Universities were astounded that an unlearned craftsman could produce works like The Three Principles of the Divine Essence and The Threefold Life of Man.But Jacob Boehme explains:I never desired to know anything of the Divine Mystery, much less understood I the way how to seek or find it. I sought only after the heart of Jesus Christ...In this my earnest Christian seeking and desire, the gate was opened unto me, so that in one quarter of an hour I saw and knew more than if I had been many years together at an University...For I saw and knew the Being of all Beings, the Byss and Abyss; also the eternal generation of the Holy Trinity; the descent, and origin of this world, and of all creatures, through the divine Wisdom; I knew and saw in myself all the three Worlds; namely, the Divine, Angelical, and Paradisical World and then the Dark World, the original of the Nature to the Fire; and then thirdly, the external, visible World, being a Procreation, or External Birth, from the two internal and spiritual Worlds; and I saw, and knew the whole working Essence in the evil, and in the good; and the mutual origin, and existence of each of them; and likewise how the fruitful bearing Womb of Eternity brought forth...And presently it came powerfully into my mind to set the same down in writing...

Almost real.<br> <br><i>He is making his way through the primitive city, an ancient place constructed of brown brick, mud, and hay. The people here are in a panic, for something attacks their homes. They run about frenzied, their frightened cries echoing throughout the cool night. Sounds of violence fill the air, blades clanging together in battle, the moans of the wounded&#x2014;and something else he can&#x2019;t quite place, a strange sound in the distance, but moving closer.</i><br> <br>Other nights he has tried to stop the frightened citizens, to catch their attention, to ask them what is happening, but they do not see or hear him. He is a ghost to their turmoil.<br> <br><i>Husbands and wives, shielding small children between them, scramble across sand-covered streets desperately searching for shelter. Again he listens to their fear-filled voices. He does not understand their language, but the meaning is quite clear. Their lives and the lives of their children are in danger.</i><br> <br>For nights too numerous to count he has come to this place, to this sad village and witnessed the panic of its people. But not once has he seen the source of their terror.<br> <br><i>He moves through the winding streets of the dream place, feeling the roughness of desert sand beneath his bare feet. Every night this city under siege becomes more real to him, and tonight he feels its fear as if it were his own. And again he asks himself,</i> fear of what? Who are they who can bring such terror to these simple people?<br> <br><i>In the marketplace a boy dressed in rags, no older than he, darts out from beneath a tarp covering a large pile of yellow, gourdlike fruit. He watches the boy stealthily travel across the deserted market, sticking close to the shadows. The boy nervously watches the sky as he runs.</i><br> <br><i>Odd that the boy would be so concerned with the sky overhead.</i><br> <br><i>The boy stops at the edge of the market and crouches within a thick pool of night. He stares longingly across the expanse of open ground at another area of darkness on the other side.</i><br> <br><i>There is unrelenting fear on the dark-skinned youth&#x2019;s face; his eyes are wide and white.</i> What is he so afraid of? <i>Aaron</i> <i>looks up himself and sees only the night, like velvet adorned with twinkling jewels. There is nothing to fear there, only beauty to admire.</i><br> <br><i>The boy darts from his hiding place and scrambles across the open area. He is halfway there when the winds begin. Sudden, powerful gusts that come out of nowhere, hurling sand, dirt, and dust.</i><br> <br><i>The boy stops short and shields his face from the scouring particles. He is blinded, unsure of his direction. Aaron wants to call to him, to help the boy escape the mysterious sandstorm, but knows that his attempts would be futile, that he is only an observer.</i><br> <br><i>And there is the sound. He can&#x2019;t place it exactly, but knows it is familiar. There is something in the sky above&#x2014;something that beats at the air, stirring the winds, creating the sudden storm.</i><br> <br><i>The boy is screaming. His sweat-dampened body is powdered almost white in a sheen of fine dust and desert sand.</i><br> <br><i>The sounds are louder now, closer.</i><br> <br>What is that? <i>The answer is right at the edge of his knowing. He again looks up into the sky. The sand still flies about, tossed by the winds. It stings his face and eyes, but he has to see&#x2014;he has to know what makes these strange pounding sounds, what creates gusts of wind powerful enough to propel sand and rock. He has to know the source of such unbridled horror in these people of the dream-city&#x2014;in this boy.</i><br> <br><i>And through the clouds of fine debris, he sees them. For the first time he sees them.</i><br> <br><i>They are wearing armor. Golden armor that glistens in the dancing light thrown from the flames of their weapons.</i><br> <br><i>The boy runs toward him. It seems that Aaron is suddenly visible. The boy reaches out, pleading to be saved in the language of his people.</i><br> <br><i>This time, he understands every word. He tries to answer, but earsplitting shrieks fill the night, the excited cries of predators that have discovered their prey.</i><br> <br><i>The boy tries to run, but there are too many.</i><br> <br><i>Aaron can do nothing but watch as the birdlike creatures descend from the sky, falling upon the boy, his plaintive screams of terror drowned out by the beating of powerful wings.</i><br> <br><i>Angels&#x2019; wings.</i><br> <b>LYNN, MASSACHUSETTS</b><p></p> <br>It was Gabriel&#x2019;s powerful, bed-shaking sneeze that pulled Aaron from the dream and back to the waking world.<br> <br>Aaron&#x2019;s eyes snapped open as another explosion of moisture dappled his face. For the moment, the dream was forgotten and all that occupied his mind was the attentions of an eighty-pound Labrador retriever named Gabriel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Unnngh,&#x201d; he moaned as he pulled his arm up from the warmth beneath the covers to wipe away the newest spattering of dog spittle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, Gabe,&#x201d; he said, his voice husky from sleep.<br> <br>&#x201c;What time is it anyway? Time to get up?&#x201d; he asked the dog lying beside him.<br> <br>The yellow retriever leaned its blocky head forward to lick the back of his exposed hand, his muscular bulk blocking Aaron&#x2019;s view of the alarm clock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay,&#x201d; Aaron said as he pulled his other hand out to ruffle the dog&#x2019;s velvety soft, golden-brown ears, and wiggled himself into an upright position to check the time.<br> <br>Craving more attention, Gabriel flipped over onto his back and swatted at Aaron with his front paws. He chuckled and rubbed the dog&#x2019;s exposed belly before training his eyes on the clock on the nightstand beside his bed.<br> <br>Aaron watched the red digital readout change from 7:28 to 7:29.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; he hissed.<br> <br>Sensing alarm in his master, Gabriel rolled from his back to his stomach with a rumbling bark.<br> <br>Aaron struggled from the bed, whipped into a frenzy by the lateness of the hour.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit,&#x201d; he repeated as he pulled off his Dave Matthews concert T-shirt and threw it onto a pile of dirty clothes in the corner of the room. He pulled down his sweatpants and kicked them into the same general vicinity. He was late. Very late.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d been studying for Mr. Arslanian&#x2019;s history exam last night, and his head was so crammed with minutiae about the Civil War that he must have forgotten to set the alarm. He had less than a half hour to get to Kenneth Curtis High School before first bell.<br> <br>Aaron lunged for his dresser and yanked clean underwear and socks from the second drawer. In the mirror above, he could see Gabriel curiously staring at him from the bed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man&#x2019;s best friend, my butt,&#x201d; he said to the dog on his way into the bathroom. &#x201c;How could you let me oversleep?&#x201d;<br> <br>Gabriel just fell to his side among the tousled bedclothes and sighed heavily.<br> <br>Aaron managed to shower, brush his teeth, and get dressed in a little more than seventeen minutes.<br> <br><i>I might be able to pull this off yet,</i> he thought as he bounded down the stairs, loaded bookbag slung over his shoulder. If he got out the door right at this moment and managed to make all the lights heading down North Common, he could probably pull into the parking lot just as the last bell rang.<br> <br>It would be close, but it was the only option he had.<br> <br>In the hallway he grabbed his jacket from the coatrack and was about to open the door when he felt Gabriel&#x2019;s eyes upon him.<br> <br>The dog stood behind him, watching him intensely, head cocked at a quizzical angle that said, &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t you forgotten something?&#x201d;<br> <br>Aaron sighed. The dog needed to be fed and taken out to do his morning business. Normally he would have had more than enough time to see to his best friend&#x2019;s needs, but today was another story.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Gabe,&#x201d; he said as he turned the doorknob. &#x201c;Lori will give you breakfast and take you out.&#x201d;<br> <br>And then it hit him. He&#x2019;d been in such a hurry to get out of the house that he hadn&#x2019;t noticed his foster mother&#x2019;s absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lori?&#x201d; he called as he stepped away from the door and quickly made his way down the hall to the kitchen. Gabriel followed close at his heels.<br> <br><i>This is odd,</i> he thought. Lori was usually the first to rise in the Stanley household. She would get up around five A.M., get the coffee brewing, and make her husband, Tom, a bag lunch so he could be out of the house and to the General Electric plant where he was a foreman, by seven sharp.<br> <br>The kitchen was empty, and with a hungry Gabriel by his side, Aaron made his way through the dining room to the living room.<br> <br>The room was dark, the shades on the four windows still drawn. The television was on, but had gone to static. His seven-year-old foster brother, Stevie, sat before the twenty-two-inch screen, staring as if watching the most amazing television program ever produced.<br> <br>Across the room, below a wall of family photos that had jokingly become known as the wall of shame, his foster mom was asleep in a leather recliner. Aaron was disturbed at how old she looked, slumped in the chair, wrapped in a worn, navy blue terry cloth robe. It was the first time he ever really thought about her growing older, and that there would be a day when she wouldn&#x2019;t be around anymore. <i>Where the hell did that come from?</i> he wondered. He pushed the strange and really depressing train of thought away and attempted to think of something more pleasant.<br> <br>When the Stanleys had taken him into their home as a foster child, it had been his seventh placement since birth. What was it that the caseworkers used to say about him? &#x201c;He&#x2019;s not a bad kid, just a bit of an introvert with a bad temper.&#x201d; Aaron smiled. He never expected the placements to last, and had imagined that there would be an eighth, ninth, and probably even a hundredth placement before he was cut loose from the foster care system and let out into the world on his own.<br> <br>A warm pang of emotion flowed through him as he remembered the care this woman and her husband had given him over the years. No matter how he misbehaved, or acted out, they stuck with him, investing their time, their energy, and most importantly, their love. The Stanleys weren&#x2019;t just collecting a check from the state; they really cared about him, and eventually he came to think of them as the parents he never knew.<br> <br>Gabriel had wandered over to the boy in front of the television and was licking his face&#x2014;Aaron knew it was only to catch the residue of the child&#x2019;s breakfast. But the boy did not respond, continuing to stare at the static on the screen, eyes wide, mouth agape.<br> <br>Steven was the Stanleys&#x2019; only biological child and he had autism, the often misunderstood mental condition that left those afflicted so absorbed with their own reality, that they were rarely able to interact with the world around them. The boy could be quite a handful and Lori stayed home to care for his special needs.<br> <br>Lori twitched and came awake with a start. &#x201c;Stevie?&#x201d; she asked groggily, looking for her young son.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s watching his favorite show,&#x201d; Aaron said, indicating Gabriel and the little boy. He looked back to his foster mom. &#x201c;You all right?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lori stretched and, pulling her robe tight around her throat, smiled at him. Her smile had always made him feel special and this morning wasn&#x2019;t any different. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, hon, just a little tired is all.&#x201d; She motioned with her chin to the boy in front of the television. &#x201c;He had a bad night and the static was the only thing that calmed him down.&#x201d;<br> <br>She glanced over at the mini&#x2013;grandfather clock hanging on the wall and squinted. &#x201c;Is that the time?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;What are you still doing here? You&#x2019;re going to be late for school.&#x201d;<br> <br>He started to explain as she sprang from the seat and began to push him from the room. &#x201c;I was up late studying and forgot to set the alarm and ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me later,&#x201d; she said as she placed the palm of her hand in the small of his back, helping him along.<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you mind feeding&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I wouldn&#x2019;t, and I&#x2019;ll take him for a walk,&#x201d; Lori said, cutting him off. &#x201c;Get to school and ace that history test.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was halfway out the door when he heard her call his name from the kitchen. There was a hint of panic in her voice.<br> <br>Aaron poked his head back in.<br> <br>&#x201c;I almost forgot,&#x201d; she said, the dog&#x2019;s bowl in one hand and a cup of dry food in the other. Gabriel stood attentively at her side, drool streaming from his mouth to form a shiny puddle at his paws.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked, a touch of impatience beginning to find its way into his tone.<br> <br>She smiled. &#x201c;Happy birthday,&#x201d; she said, and pursed her lips in a long distance kiss. &#x201c;Have a great day.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>My birthday,</i> he thought closing the door behind him and running to his car.<br> <br>With all the rushing about this morning, he&#x2019;d forgotten.<br> <br>Aaron squeaked into homeroom just as the day&#x2019;s announcements were being read over the school&#x2019;s ancient PA system.<br> <br>Mrs. Mihos, the elderly head of the math department mere months away from retirement, looked up from her copy of <i>Family Circle</i> and gave him an icy stare.<br> <br>He mouthed the words &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201d; and quickly found his seat. He had learned that the less said to Mrs. Mihos the better. Her edicts were simple: Be on time to homeroom, turn in notes to explain absences in a timely fashion, and whatever you do, don&#x2019;t be a wiseass. Aaron chillingly recalled how Tommy Philips, now seated at the back of the classroom intently keeping his mouth shut, had attempted to be the funny guy. He&#x2019;d written a joke letter to explain an absence, and found himself with a week&#x2019;s worth of detentions. There was nothing the math teacher hated more than a wiseass.<br> <br>Aaron chanced a look at the old woman and saw that she was flipping through the attendance sheets to change his status from absent to present. He breathed a sigh of relief as the first period bell began to ring. <i>Maybe today wouldn&#x2019;t be a total disaster after all.</i><br> <br>First period American Literature went fine, but halfway through second period, while taking Mr. Arslanian&#x2019;s test, Aaron decided that he couldn&#x2019;t have been more wrong about the day. Not only was he blanking on some of the information he had studied, but he also had one of the worst headaches he could ever remember. His head felt as if it were vibrating, buzzing like someone had left an electric shaver running inside his skull. He rubbed at his brow furiously and tried to focus on an essay question about the social and political ramifications of the Richmond Bread Riot. Arslanian&#x2019;s fascination with obscure events of the Civil War was going to give him an aneurysm.<br> <br>The remainder of the class passed in the blink of an eye, and Aaron wondered if he had passed out or maybe even been taken by space aliens. He had barely finished the last of the essay questions when the end-of-period bell clanged, a real plus for the pain in his head. He quickly glanced over the pages of his test. It wasn&#x2019;t the best he&#x2019;d ever done, but considering how he felt, he didn&#x2019;t think it was too bad.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to give you another couple of hours to wrap the test up in a pretty pink bow, Mr. Corbet ...&#x201d;<br> <br>A...</p><h2>Ex-Heroes: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;<i>The Avengers</i> meets <i>The Walking Dead</i> with a large order of epic served on the side. . . .

Check. <i>Ex-Heroes</i>&nbsp;has it all. You're in for a treat!&#x201d;&#x2014;Mira Grant, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Feed</i></b></p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Peter Clines</b></p> <p><strong>Q. You grew up in Stephen King territory in Maine, yes? Did that make you into a zombie fan at an early age?</strong></p> <p>A. Well, I was at the southern edges of Mr. King&#x2019;s fallout zone. It&#x2019;s a little town called Cape Neddick, a little tourist place on the coast, and someone told me once that the population was ten times bigger in the summer than in the winter. And to be honest, I was terrified of everything as a kid. <i>Land of the Lost</i> gave me nightmares. Heck, there was an episode of <i>Fantasy Island</i> that gave me nightmares. I was right there when King&#x2019;s career really exploded, but his books terrified me. I finally worked up my courage to read one of his short stories, &#x201c;The Boogeyman,&#x201d; when I was twelve or so, and to this day I can&#x2019;t sleep with the closet door open. The original <i>Ghost Rider</i> comics were my first tentative steps into horror, and even some of those freaked me out. My love of the genre really blossomed in college.</p> <p><strong>Q. Have you always wanted to be a writer?</strong></p> <p>A. Well, to quote George Carlin, not in the womb, but right after that . . . yeah. I can remember making scenes with my <i>Star Wars</i> figures and adjusting them all each night as their story progressed. In third grade I hand-wrote a &#x201c;novel&#x201d; that I called <i>Lizard Men from the Center of the Earth</i>, which was about . . . well, guess. Once I discovered my mom&#x2019;s old Smith-Corona typewriter it was all over. I spent all my free time writing comic books and some truly awful Boba Fett fan fiction before there was such a term. I even made some early attempts at novels. One of the great tragedies of American literature is that our garage flooded in high school and all of that was destroyed. (It&#x2019;s not really a tragedy . . .) </p> <p><strong>Q. It sounds like you were&#x2014;no offense&#x2014;kind of a comic geek when you were a kid?</strong></p> <p>A. When I was a kid, yeah. And a teenager. And a college student. To be honest, writing comic books was my big goal when I was little. My first rejection letters are from Jim Shooter&#x2014;then Marvel&#x2019;s editor in chief&#x2014;because I would send him some of those (in retrospect) really God-awful stories every other month. With cover art. This is back when I was maybe ten or eleven. He was amazingly polite to a stupid kid. On one level, <i>Ex-Heroes</i> was my chance to finally write the kind of heroes I grew up with.</p> <p><strong>Q. Do you have a favorite superhero?</strong></p> <p>A. I&#x2019;m a long-time Spider-Man fan. I started collecting <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> when I was about nine or ten and kept with it for years. I&#x2019;ve got one of those big longboxes just filled with issues. I finally got so frustrated, though, with Marvel&#x2019;s big &#x201c;Civil War&#x201d; promotion, and especially how they resolved it. When Spider-Man made a deal with the devil to erase half his life, including his wife and best friend . . . well, I was done. </p> <p><strong>Q. It sounds like you&#x2019;re not really interested in comics now, though. What do you think about mainstream comics these days?</strong></p> <p>A. Tough question. I am a bit disillusioned with the big two comic publishers. To be clear, I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a problem with using the medium of comics to tell more dramatic, adult-themed stories. <i>The Sandman, The Walking Dead, Unknown Soldier</i>&#x2014;these are all fantastic stories by great writers. My problem is when this sort of storytelling gets pushed onto characters like Spider-Man or Superman or Captain America, because &#x201c;dramatic&#x201d; becomes shorthand for &#x201c;really messed up.&#x201d; I think it detracts from these classic characters to push them into molds they weren&#x2019;t meant to fill, and those stories tend to just come across as pointless melodrama. Characters have six-page soliloquies about the nature of heroism rather than just doing something heroic. I&#x2019;ve seen people try to do &#x201c;realistic&#x201d; stories with the Hulk . . . a character who got his powers by standing next to a nuclear bomb when it went off. These elements can be a nice polish on a story, but there&#x2019;s also a point where they have no business being used. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a coincidence that the industry has been struggling so much since this type of storytelling became the norm.</p> <p><strong>Q. When you moved to California you ended up working in the film industry for almost fifteen years. What kind of work did you do there?</strong></p> <p>A. I was a property master&#x2014;the person who deals with hand props&#x2014;on a lot of television shows and movies. I worked on a lot of cult things like one of the <i>Beastmaster</i> movies, <i>Veronica Mars</i>, and a bunch of lesser-known stuff. I&#x2019;m actually the murderer in <i>Psycho Beach Party</i> for most of the movie. I prop-mastered Helen Mirren&#x2019;s directorial debut, and she told me I looked like the type of person who should be sitting on the porch of a southern plantation writing novels.Also, I was writing scripts on the side. People looked at some of my feature scripts and television episodes, and I made the final round in a bunch of screenplay contests. All this industry experience led to a job writing articles for <i>Creative Screenwriting</i> magazine, which I did for several years. I interviewed George Romero, Kevin Smith, Sylvester Stallone, Orci &amp; Kurtzman, and dozens and dozens of other writers and directors.</p><p><b>PETER CLINES</b> has published several pieces of short fiction and countless articles on the film and television industries, as well as the novels <i>Ex-Patriots, Ex-Communication</i>, <i>Ex-Purgatory</i>, and <i>14</i>. &nbsp;He lives and writes&nbsp;in southern California.</p></p><h2>A Gentleman Never Keeps Score: Seducing the Sedgwicks (Seducing the Sedgwicks, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>If you haven&#x2019;t read Cat Sebastian, what are you waiting for?&#x201d;&#x2014;Lorraine Heath,<em> New York Times </em>bestselling author</strong></p><p><em></em>&nbsp;</p><p>Once beloved by London's fashionable elite, Hartley Sedgwick has become a recluse after a spate of salacious gossip exposed his most-private secrets.

Hordes began to hear stories of Hispanos who lit candles on Friday night and abstained from eating pork. Puzzling over the matter, Hordes realized that these practices might very well have been passed down through the centuries from early crypto-Jewish settlers in New Spain. After extensive research and hundreds of interviews, Hordes concluded that there was, in New Mexico and the Southwest, a Sephardic legacy derived from the <i>converso</i> community of Spanish Jews.<br><br>In <i>To the End of the Earth</i>, Hordes explores the remarkable story of crypto-Jews and the tenuous preservation of Jewish rituals and traditions in Mexico and New Mexico over the past five hundred years. He follows the crypto-Jews from their Jewish origins in medieval Spain and Portugal to their efforts to escape persecution by migrating to the New World and settling in the far reaches of the northern Mexican frontier. <br><br>Drawing on individual biographies (including those of colonial officials accused of secretly practicing Judaism), family histories, Inquisition records, letters, and other primary sources, Hordes provides a richly detailed account of the economic, social and religious lives of crypto-Jews during the colonial period and after the annexation of New Mexico by the United States in 1846. While the American government offered more religious freedom than had the Spanish colonial rulers, cultural assimilation into Anglo-American society weakened many elements of the crypto-Jewish tradition. <br><br>Hordes concludes with a discussion of the reemergence of crypto-Jewish culture and the reclamation of Jewish ancestry within the Hispano community in the late twentieth century. He examines the publicity surrounding the rediscovery of the crypto-Jewish community and explores the challenges inherent in a study that attempts to reconstruct the history of a people who tried to leave no documentary record.</p><p>Stanley M.

These stories of great women who have achieved full illumination, overcoming cultural prejudices and a host of other problems which male practitioners do not encounter, offer a wealth of inspiration to everyone on the spiritual path. <br><br>In this revised and expanded edition, Tsultrim Allione's extensive autobiographical preface and introduction speak directly to the difficulties and triumphs of women in the West who pursue a spiritual life, as she shares her own stories and experiences. <i>Women of Wisdom</i> offers valuable insights to all those interested in women's spirituality, regardless of background or tradition.<br>This new edition includes Tsultrim's expanded autobiography, covering the last fifteen years since the first edition appeared.</p><p>Tsultrim Allione is one of the first American women to be ordained a nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. But blazing a trail for Buddhist women in the West required models of great women practitioners. In the first book of its kind, Allione brings together the biographies of six women mystics in this strong but little known Tibetan tradition. Make that seven women, as Allione expands her own spiritual autobiography into 80 pages in this new printing. The dakini principle, the principle of feminine transformation, pervades each of these stories. A woman is beaten by her husband and father-in-law and has her son taken from her but later comes face-to-face with the boddhisattva Tara and becomes a great teacher. A wife who has always dreamed of practicing the dharma splits from her husband and travels the land receiving teachings. A poor cow herder is given a long-hidden sacred text and becomes a dakini herself. A spiritual biography embodies a teaching, and these stories enchant while transmitting wisdom. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Tsultrim Allione is one of the most widely known contemporary Western women teachers of Buddhism. She received her master&#39;s degree from Antioch University in Buddhism/Women&#39;s Studies and was among the first Western women ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun. She has been a practicing Buddhist for over thirty years and has taught throughout the world, making great efforts to create teaching methods which facilitate the Western understanding of Buddhism. She is founder and director of Tara Mandala, a retreat center in Pagosa Springs, Colorado, that has been described as one of the most dynamic new Buddhist centers in North America.

The book focuses on the influence of international timber giant Weyerhaeuser Company in the Pacific Northwest, yet its themes resonate from Alaska to the American Southeast--wherever timber is king. While spurning nostalgia for logging's glory days, <i>Deadfall</i> attempts to view a future for today's timber workers.</p><p>James LeMonds has lived most of his life in Castle Rock, Washington, a logging town in the shadow of Mount St. Helens. The son of a log truck driver, LeMonds first tasted the danger and grueling conditions of work in the woods during two summers spent as a choker setter--which quickly cured him of any desire to leave college for the life of a logger.&#34;Lemonds&#39;s great accomplishment . . . is the manner in which he tells this tale--not as sweeping overview, but as underview, so to speak--as heartfelt personal account of three generations in his family and his town.&#34;</p><h2>Slavery and Public History: The Tough Stuff of American Memory</h2><p>America's slave past is being analyzed as never before, yet it remains one of the most contentious issues in U.S. memory.

You know which one, the second on the left.&#x201d;</p><p>Cava felt cold. The windowless latrine was at the far end of the barracks, behind a thin wooden door. In other years the wind had only got into the barracks of the cadets, poking through the broken panes and the cracks in the walls, but this year it was stronger and hardly any place in the academy was free from it. At night it even got into the latrines, driving out the stink that accumulated during the day, and also the warmth. But Cava had been born and brought up in the mountains, cold weather was nothing new to him: it was fear that was giving him goose pimples.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it over?&#x201d; the Boa asked. &#x201c;Can I go to bed?&#x201d; He had a huge body, a deep voice, a shock of greasy hair over a narrow face. His eyes were sunken from lack of sleep, and a shred of tobacco dangled from his jutting lower lip. The Jaguar turned and looked at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to go on guard at one,&#x201d; the Boa said. &#x201c;I want to grab a little sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go ahead, both of you,&#x201d; the Jaguar said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wake you up at five to.&#x201d;</p><p>Curly and the Boa went out. One of them tripped on the threshold and swore.</p><p>&#x201c;Wake me up as soon as you get back,&#x201d; the Jaguar said to Cava. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t take too long. It&#x2019;s almost midnight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know it.&#x201d; Usually Cava&#x2019;s face was expressionless, but now it looked exhausted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get dressed.&#x201d;</p><p>They left the latrine. The barracks was dark, but Cava could find his way along the two rows of double bunks without a light: he knew that long, tall room by heart. It was silent except for a few snores and murmurs. His bunk was the second on the right, about a yard from the outside door. As he groped in his locker for his trousers and his khaki shirt and his boots, he could smell the tobacco-sour breath of Vallano, who slept in the upper bunk. Even in the darkness he could make out the double row of the Negro&#x2019;s big white teeth, and they reminded him of a rat. Slowly, quietly, he took off his blue flannel pajamas and got dressed. He put on his wool jacket and went down to the Jaguar&#x2019;s bunk at the other end of the barracks, next to the latrine, walking carefully because his boots squeaked.</p><p>&#x201c;Jaguar.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Here, take them.&#x201d;</p><p>Cava&#x2019;s hand reached out and touched two hard, cold objects, one of them rough. He kept the flashlight in his hand and slipped the file into his pocket.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s on guard?&#x201d; Cava asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Me and the Poet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Slave&#x2019;s taking my place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the ones from the other sections?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you scared?&#x201d;</p><p>Cava did not answer. He tiptoed to the outside door and opened it as carefully as he could, but it still creaked on its hinges.</p><p>&#x201c;A crook!&#x201d; somebody shouted in the darkness. &#x201c;Kill him, sentry!&#x201d;</p><p>Cava could not recognize the voice. He looked out into the patio. It was completely empty in the dim light from the lamps around the parade ground, which lay between the barracks and a weed-grown field. The drifting fog obscured the outlines of the three cement hulks where the Fifth Year cadets were quartered, making them look unreal. He went outside and stood for a few moments with his back against the barracks wall. He could not count on anyone now: even the Jaguar was safe. He envied the sleeping cadets, the noncoms, the soldiers in their barracks at the other side of the stadium. He knew he would be paralyzed by fear unless he kept going. He calculated the distance: he had to cross the patio and the parade ground; then, protected by the shadows in the field, he had to skirt the mess hall, the offices and the officers&#x2019; quarters; and finally he had to cross another patio&#x2014;this one small and paved with cement&#x2014;that faced the classroom building. The danger would end there, because the patrol never went that far. Then, the trip back to his barracks. In a confused way he wanted to lose his will and imagination and just carry out the plan like a blind machine. Sometimes he could go for several days following a routine that made all the decisions for him, gently nudging him into actions he hardly noted. This was different. What was happening tonight had been forced on him. He felt unusually clearheaded and he knew perfectly well what he was doing.</p><p>He began to walk, keeping close up to the wall. Instead of crossing the patio he went around it, following the curved wall of the Fifth&#x2019;s barracks. When he came to the end of it he looked around anxiously: the parade ground seemed vast and mysterious, outlined by the symmetrically-placed lamps around which the fog was gathering. He could picture the shadowy field beyond the lamps. The sentries liked to stretch out there, either to sleep or to talk in whispers, when it was not too cold. But he was sure that tonight they were all gambling in one of the latrines. He began to walk quickly in the shadows of the buildings on his left, avoiding the splotches of light. The squeaking of his boots was drowned by the crash of the surf against the cliffs bordering one side of the Academy grounds. When he reached the officers&#x2019; quarters he shivered and walked even faster. Then he cut across the parade ground and plunged into the shadows of the field. A sudden movement near him, as startling as a blow, brought back all the fears he had begun to overcome. He hesitated for a moment; then he could make out the eyes of the vicu�a, as bright as glowworms, regarding him with a wide, gentle stare. &#x201c;Get out of here!&#x201d; he said to it angrily. The animal remained motionless. That damned thing never sleeps, Cava thought. It doesn&#x2019;t even eat. What keeps it alive? He moved on. Two and a half years ago, when he came to Lima to finish school, he was amazed to find that creature from the mountains wandering calmly among the gray, weather-beaten walls of the Leoncio Prado Military Academy. Who had brought the vicu�a to the Academy? From what part of the Andes? The cadets used him as a target, but the vicu�a hardly paid any attention when the stones hit him. He simply walked away from the boys with a look of utter indifference. It looks like an Indian, Cava thought. He went up the stairs to the classrooms. He was not worried now about the sound of his boots: the building was empty except for the desks and the benches, the wind and the shadows. He crossed the upper lobby with long quick strides. Then he stopped. The faint beam of the flashlight showed him the window. The second on the left, the Jaguar had said. And yes, he was right, it was loose. Cava started gouging out the putty with the pointed end of the file, collecting it in his other hand. It felt damp and decayed. Then he carefully removed the pane of glass and laid it on the tile floor. He groped until he found the lock, and swung the window wide open. Inside, he turned his flashlight in every direction. On one of the tables, next to the mimeograph machine, there were three stacks of paper. He read: Bimonthly Examination in Chemistry, Fifth Year. Examination Time, 40 Minutes. The sheets had been mimeographed that afternoon and the ink was still somewhat moist. He copied the questions hurriedly into a notebook without understanding what they meant. He turned off the flashlight, went back to the window, climbed up and jumped. The pane of glass exploded into hundreds of strident splinters. &#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; he grunted. He remained crouching, listening, trembling with terror. But he could not hear the wild tumult he expected, the pistol-shot voices of the officers: only his own panting. He waited for a few more seconds. Then, forgetting to use the flashlight, he picked up the broken glass as well as he could and put it into his pockets. He walked back to his barracks without taking the slightest precaution. He wanted to get there as soon as he could, he wanted to climb into his bunk and shut his eyes. As he crossed the field he took the broken glass out of his pockets and threw it away, cutting his hands as he did so. He stopped for a moment in the doorway to his barracks, catching his breath. A dark shape loomed up in front of him.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay?&#x201d; the Jaguar asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in the latrine.&#x201d;</p><p>The Jaguar went first, pushing at the double door with both hands. In the yellow light Cava could see that the Jaguar was barefoot, could see and smell his big pale feet with their long dirty toenails.</p><p>&#x201c;I broke the glass,&#x201d; he said in a low voice.</p><p>The Jaguar&#x2019;s hands came at him like two white claws and fastened on the lapels of his jacket. Cava swayed backward but kept his eyes on those of the Jaguar, who was glaring at him from below his curled-up lashes.</p><p>&#x201c;You peasant,&#x201d; the Jaguar muttered. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a peasant. If they catch us, by God I&#x2019;ll...&#x201d;</p><p>He was still holding on to the lapels, so Cava put his hands on the Jaguar&#x2019;s, timidly trying to loosen them.</p><p>&#x201c;Keep your hands off!&#x201d; the Jaguar said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just a peasant!&#x201d; Cava could feel the spit spraying his face. He lowered his hands.</p><p>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t anyone in the patio,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t see me.&#x201d;</p><p>The Jaguar released him and stood nibbling the back of his hand.</p><p>&#x201c;You know I&#x2019;m not a squealer, Ja...</p></p><h2>The Marquis: Lafayette Reconsidered</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2015 American Library in Paris Book Award</b><br><br>The Marquis de Lafayette at age nineteen volunteered to fight under George Washington and became the French hero of the American Revolution.

Coming to a sudden stop at an unmarked door, he rifled through a ring of oversized keys, turned the latch, and switched on a light to reveal a small, sparsely furnished room coated with a fine film of dust. This was clearly not one of the ch�teau&#x2019;s most popular locations, but it contained the treasure I had come to see: a white marble bust of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757&#x2013;1834). Carved in 1790 by the renowned sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, the bust portrays Lafayette as an officer and a gentleman: his uniform signals his cherished role as commander of the French National Guard, his powdered coiffure is expertly arranged, and his firm jaw and oblique gaze suggest absorption in matters of grave importance.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I admired this noble countenance of stone, a wry smile crept across the curator&#x2019;s face. Suddenly, the silence was broken. &#x201c;Why,&#x201d; asked the curator, &#x201c;should we have a bust of Lafayette?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The question surprised me. After all, I said, Lafayette is the French hero of the American Revolution&#x2014;the Hero of Two Worlds, the Apostle of Liberty. I had learned about him in school and knew that he was worthy of admiration. Lafayette was just nineteen years old and one of the richest men in France when he relinquished the comforts of his station to serve the cause of freedom half a world away. &#x201c;The Marquis,&#x201d; as Americans called him, led our troops into battle, froze with them at Valley Forge, and clothed and fed them at his own expense. News of Lafayette&#x2019;s daring adventures thrilled all of France, and that excitement encouraged the French king, Louis XVI&#x2014;an absolute monarch&#x2014;to support a revolution. Knowing that Lafayette helped us win independence, generations of Americans have expressed our nation&#x2019;s gratitude by naming countless towns, counties, streets, parks, and schools in his honor. Lafayette is so esteemed in the United States that his statue stands across from the White House, in Washington, D.C.&#x2019;s Lafayette Square. A bust is just one more token of well-deserved appreciation.<br>&nbsp;<br>After listening politely, the curator shook his head and pointed to a plaque installed a few feet away. It was a memorial commemorating the deaths of thousands of French soldiers and sailors who, sent across the Atlantic by their king, had lost their lives fighting for American freedom. He repeated the question, a bit louder this time: &#x201c;Why should we have a bust of Lafayette?&#x201d; These men were killed in the American Revolution, he said, but they have no statues. Louis XVI bankrupted France for the cause of American liberty and received his thanks from the guillotine. Besides, it was not Lafayette but the Comte de Rochambeau who led the French forces in America. How and why did we come to revere&#x2014;of all the sons of France who came to America&#x2019;s aid&#x2014;the Marquis de Lafayette?<br>&nbsp;<br>I began to see his point. During the winter of 1776, Lafayette&#x2019;s inter- est in the American cause was not unique. In fact, it could hardly be called unusual. The fashionable salons of Paris were abuzz that season with talk of &#x201c;les insurgents,&#x201d; as the envoys sent by Congress were fondly known, and a card game called &#x201c;Le Boston&#x201d; was sweeping through high society. The best French homes feted George Washington in absentia, and Benjamin Franklin delighted all of Paris, where he cut a conspicuous figure in a marten-fur cap&#x2014;an accessory that toyed with French perceptions of rustic Americans.<br>&nbsp;<br>If pleasure-loving Parisians enjoyed the novelty of these New World republicans, many military men saw the Americans&#x2019; cause as an opportunity for revenge. The army had been nursing its wounds since 1763, when the French and Indian War (known in France as the Seven Years&#x2019; War) had ended with France ceding its Canadian colonies to Great Britain. By helping to wrest thirteen valuable colonies from British control, a humiliated French officers&#x2019; corps hoped to redeem itself. So pervasive was enthusiasm for the American fight that the economist and author Andr� Morellet&#x2014;an astute social observer who often accompanied Franklin on his rounds&#x2014;quipped in 1777 that &#x201c;there is more support for American independence in Paris than in the entire province of New York.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet there was something uncommon about Lafayette&#x2019;s commitment to America. His devotion was deeper than his countrymen&#x2019;s, his drive more intense. While other Frenchmen sailed for the New World seeking riches or retribution, Lafayette sought nothing short of a new life. Earnest, enthusiastic&#x2014;as optimistic as Voltaire&#x2019;s na�f Candide&#x2014;Lafayette was out of place in the glittering Parisian world of wit and cynicism that the urbane Franklin so effortlessly mastered.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette had married into one of the best-connected families of the French court, but he hailed from the Auvergne region of south-central France, and the uncontrived manners of that rural area marked him as a stranger in the refined circles of his in-laws. At Versailles, even Lafayette&#x2019;s rugged appearance counted against him. The young marquis was large for his time: five feet, nine inches tall and endowed with a broad frame that one contemporary described as &#x201c;decidedly inclined to embonpoint.&#x201d; In other words, he tended to be stout. As Lafayette grew older, his bold features would be called distinguished, but as a youth he was not widely perceived as handsome. He had a long, oval face with a prominent aquiline nose, gray-blue eyes that peered out from a pale complexion, and a shock of unfashionably red hair atop a high, sloping forehead. Friends and admirers saw Lafayette&#x2019;s open and frank expression as a window to his soul, but this transparent credulity placed him at a disadvantage in the dissimulating games of intrigue that passed for sociability at Versailles.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette felt more comfortable in the saddle than perched on a gilded stool, and he remained uneasy in a society that cultivated an ideal of disaffected nonchalance; feigned detachment was foreign to his character. Reared on tales of his ancestors&#x2019; military exploits, Lafayette yearned to prove himself worthy of such a legacy. Enthusiasm may have been unfashionable, but Lafayette made no attempt to hide his zeal. The &#x201c;love of glory,&#x201d; Lafayette recalled in his memoirs, inspired him to excel at school, where he vied for academic prizes bestowed in public ceremonies. The urge to escape &#x201c;a life without glory,&#x201d; he explained to his wife in 1777, compelled him to sail for America. &#x201c;Glory,&#x201d; he assured George Washington in 1778, was his only ambition. To be clear, the glory Lafayette sought was quite divorced from notions of splendor. In 1762, a French dictionary defined &#x201c;glory&#x201d; as a &#x201c;reputation&#x201d; garnered through &#x201c;virtue, merit, great qualities, good actions and beautiful works&#x201d;; synonyms included &#x201c;honor, esteem, praise.&#x201d; Once earned, glory was its own reward. Many men of Lafayette&#x2019;s generation hoped for glory, but Lafayette was single-mindedly devoted to its pursuit.<br>&nbsp;<br>In America, Lafayette found glory and more. Here, for the first time since leaving the Auvergne, he was surrounded by people who saw his sincerity as a virtue, not a flaw. The public welcomed him immediately&#x2014; Lafayette was the only marquis in the American army, and his title all but guaranteed his renown. The same nation that rejected Old World traditions of hereditary privilege rejoiced to find a highborn nobleman on its side, as if his interest in the American cause proved its universal appeal. And if Lafayette&#x2019;s rank opened doors, his personality won hearts. As news of Lafayette&#x2019;s unaffected charm made its way through the colonies, even the most hardened anti-French feelings began to dis- solve. Then as now, Americans prided themselves on plain dealing, and those who met Lafayette were pleasantly surprised to discover that this exceptional Frenchman shared their sensibility.<br>&nbsp;<br>Surely Lafayette deserves to be remembered. Why, then, had the French curator seemed perplexed by the bust?<br>&nbsp;<br>Part of the answer is that Lafayette succeeded so completely in cultivating an American identity that, even in France, he remains a distinctly American hero. In 1781, after the British surrendered to allied forces at Yorktown, most of the French officers in America returned to France and to the pursuits they had left behind. But Lafayette, who had left his homeland as an outcast, had no career to reprise. Serving as America&#x2019;s foremost French advocate became his primary occupation, and the spirit of the new nation assumed a position at the very core of his being. Lafayette, who called Washington his adoptive father, turned his Left Bank town house into a home away from home for visiting Americans. The Adamses, the Jeffersons, and the ubiquitous Franklin were frequent guests at Monday suppers, where English was the language of choice and where Lafayette&#x2019;s children&#x2014;including his son, named George Washington, and a daughter known as Virginie&#x2014;sang songs in English. Mementos of the United States abounded: a gold- engraved copy of the Declaration of Independence hung on a wall of honor, plants from the New World decorated the terrace, and books on American history filled the shelves. For a time, a young man of Iroquois descent lived with Lafayette&#x2019;s family as &#x201c;a favourite Servant.&#x201d; As the explorer John Ledyard wrote of Lafayette in 1787, &#x201c;he has planted a tree in America, and sits under its shade at Versailles.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But the curator may not have been objecting to Lafayette&#x2019;s Americanization; more likely he was hinting at a darker chapter of Lafayette&#x2019;s story. Although Lafayette was an indefatigable champion of righteous causes, he did not always meet with success. During the French Revolution, he failed spectacularly. In America, we remember his triumphs; in France, few outside of his native Auvergne see him as a hero. So little does France love Lafayette that the monumental Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution, published by a leading team of French historians in 1988, states flatly that &#x201c;the man has drawn few eulogies.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the outset of the French Revolution, in 1789, Lafayette&#x2019;s moment of glory seemed to be at hand. On July 15, the morning after the storming of the Bastille prison, popular acclaim placed Lafayette at the helm of the newly established National Guard. The following month, Lafayette became the first person to submit a proposal for a &#x201c;Declaration of the Rights of Man&#x201d;&#x2014;a set of principles that would serve as the foundation of a new constitution&#x2014;to France&#x2019;s newly formed legislature. On July 14, 1790, Paris commemorated the first anniversary of the Bastille&#x2019;s fall with a grand public festival featuring Lafayette as its undisputed star. Newspapers and broadsides compared Lafayette to Washington, and prints depicted him as a vanquisher of despotism, wielding a sword of justice.<br>&nbsp;<br>Yet Lafayette&#x2019;s French triumphs were troubled from the start. As commander of the National Guard, Lafayette was charged with the impossible task of keeping the peace in a city racked by violence. Time and again Lafayette looked on helplessly as brutal justice was meted out in the streets, and he grew to loathe the politicians who, in his view, incited the crowds to further their own interests. Although he had assisted at the birth of the United States, Lafayette rejected the notion that France could sustain an American-style republic. He believed that France&#x2019;s monarchical traditions were too ancient and revered to be cast aside, and he deemed the French people too uneducated and uninterested, perhaps even temperamentally unsuited, to shoulder the burden of self-governance. Lafayette never embraced radical politics, and he made enemies of those who did. As he saw it, a constitutional monarchy was the only form of government that could guarantee liberty in France, and he defended this view to the end. In the revolution&#x2019;s early days, many forward-thinking men and women shared the same hope. But as the nation grew increasingly polarized, most of his allies abandoned the dream, while Lafayette stood fast on a middle ground that was rapidly eroding.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette was proud to call himself a moderate in an era of extremes. Explaining his philosophy later in life, he insisted that &#x201c;true moderation consists, not as many people seem to think, in always seeking the middle between any two points . . . but in trying to recognize the point of truth and holding to it.&#x201d; Rarely has a man held to moderate principles with such tenacity. By 1791, partisans on both the left and the right (these political terms emerged precisely during this period) came to see him as a traitor to their respective causes. Supporters of the monarchy denounced him as a rabble-rouser. Centrist rivals falsely accused him of carrying on an affair with the despised queen Marie Antoinette&#x2014; and commissioned a memorable series of pornographic pamphlets and prints to drive the point home. Republicans lambasted him for perceived attacks on freedom of the press. As circumstances grew ever more desperate, Lafayette made increasingly grievous mistakes. One by one, the crown, the people, and, finally, the army turned against him. Had he not fled the country in 1792, Lafayette would surely have been executed. Still he clung to his principles. By the end, they were very nearly all he had left.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette was only thirty-four years old when he went into exile, and although he lived to be seventy-six and remained active in French politics until his final days, he never stopped thinking, writing, and talking about the historic events of his young adulthood. Those events defined his life, and for that reason, they form the core of this book. Writing in 1815 to the author Benjamin Constant&#x2014;a friend and political ally&#x2014;Lafayette took a moment to reflect on a remarkable lifetime that had been filled with bold dreams, tremendous achievements, and tragic failures. &#x201c;I have been reproached all my life,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;for giving in too much to my hopeful disposition; I will respond that it is the only way to do something out of the ordinary. One would, indeed, never try anything extraordinary if one despaired of success.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Why should we have a bust of Lafayette? Not because he was infallible or superhuman or endowed with gifts that the rest of us lack. We should have a bust of Lafayette precisely because he was all too human. He lived in treacherous times and made imperfect choices. He failed at more ventures than most of us will ever attempt and succeeded at efforts that stymied countless men, but he never abandoned the belief that he could change the world, and he never despaired of success. Of all his accomplishments, these might be the most extraordinary.</p><h2>Beginner&#39;s Illustrated Guide to Gardening: Techniques to Help You Get Started</h2><p><i>Beginner's Illustrated Guide to Gardening </i>is a one-stop, easy to understand, beautifully designed book with step-by-step instructions and photographs for every important gardening and landscaping technique.

Seven political prisoners escape from a Nazi prison camp; in response, the camp commandant has seven trees harshly pruned to resemble seven crosses: they will serve as posts to torture each recaptured prisoner, and capture, of course, is certain. Meanwhile, the escapees split up and flee across Germany, looking for such help and shelter as they can find along the way, determined to reach the border.

She was a sickly and introverted child by her own account, but became an intellectually curious student, eventually earning a doctorate in art history at the University of Heidelberg in 1924; her first story, written under the name Antje Seghers, was published in the same year. In 1925 she married a Hungarian immigrant economist and began her writing career in earnest. By 1929 Seghers had joined the Communist Party, given birth to her first child, and received the Kleist Prize for her first novel, <i>The Revolt of the Fishermen</i>. Having settled in France in 1933, Seghers was forced to flee again after the 1940 Nazi invasion. With the aid of Varian Fry, Seghers, her husband, and two children sailed from Marseille to Mexico on a ship that included among its passengers Victor Serge, Andr� Breton, and Claude L�vi-Strauss. After the war she moved to East Berlin, where she became an emblematic figure of East German letters, actively championing the work of younger writers from her position as president of the Writers Union and publishing at a steady pace.

She lives in Nantucket.1<br><br>When Aaron&#x2019;s Volvo pulled up to the curb of the Barnaby house, Bella felt just a bit giddy.<br>She&#x2019;d met Aaron Waterhouse in December, right after she&#x2019;d returned home to Dragonfly Lake to help her mother, and the connection had been instantaneous and electric.<br>Aaron was handsome, sweet, sexy, and smart. He was the first man she&#x2019;d ever wanted to marry. While Bella was growing up, her own family had been happy&#x2014;noisy and messy, but happy&#x2014;and Bella wanted one like that for herself. Lots of children, toys on the floor, flour on the kitchen counter while she taught her son or daughter to make popovers (so much fun for children), a husband who would come home from work with a smile on his face to toss his children into the air&#x2014;and who could make her melt at the sight of him, the way she was melting now.<br>She could have all that with Aaron. He had just gotten his master&#x2019;s in architecture. He was putting out feelers for jobs and was sure to get a good one. He was so bright, so reliable. He wanted children. He was in love with her. She was in love with him, and the vision of their life together was enticing.<br>But there was one enormous problem: Aaron had been invited to interview for a job in San Francisco.<br>San Francisco excited Aaron. Bella didn&#x2019;t want to leave Massachusetts.<br>She&#x2019;d left already, plenty of times. She&#x2019;d seen foreign places.<br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;d traveled to Paris, to Italy, to Amsterdam. She&#x2019;d lived in Utah and in Texas.<br>Now she wanted to get started with her own real life. She wanted to live here, near Dragonfly Lake, a world she knew and cherished. It wasn&#x2019;t just the landscape and the closeness of her family. It was more than that&#x2014;it was as if she were falling in love with a new vision of herself, as if at twenty-seven a mist were evaporating from a mirror, allowing her true image to show clear.<br>It was early June. Bella and Aaron had been together for five months, growing closer every day. She was pretty sure Aaron was about to propose to her. And she didn&#x2019;t know what her answer would be.<br>&#x201c;Bell!&#x201d; Her older brother, Ben, stuck his head into the living room. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m driving down to the Hortons&#x2019; with our beach chairs and the food.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; Bella answered. &#x201c;Aaron and I will walk down.&#x201d;<br>Ben went out the door and headed to his Jeep Cherokee, with its four-wheel drive, good for the snowy months, and its back hatch, good for carrying lots of stuff. Ben was practical, scientific, and methodical. He had a PhD and a tenured position at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. His life revolved in a precise circle like planets orbiting the sun.<br>Bella&#x2019;s life felt more like a Slinky flopping down the stairs.<br>She grinned at her own joke. At least she still had her sense of humor. You couldn&#x2019;t live in a family of four Barnaby children, all with a first name that began with the letter B, without developing a sense of humor. And she was happy, and an optimist, glad to be home, full of hope for the future. Her life wasn&#x2019;t tragic. Just a puzzle.<br>Bella had spent the last two and a half years teaching third grade<br>in Austin, Texas, until last Christmas, when her mother, while trying to put the angel on top of the tree, fell off the ladder and broke her leg. Bella&#x2019;s father taught high school English five days a week. Bella&#x2019;s older sister, Beatrice, was busy in her house an hour away with her three little children. Ben, of course, had his own apartment in Amherst, his students, and lab. Seventeen-year-old Brady was still in high school. So Bella abbreviated her contract, left Austin after the first semester, and flew home to take over her mother&#x2019;s shop and help around the house.<br>She was surprised to discover she didn&#x2019;t miss teaching. She was exhilarated to be back home, which for her was not just the comfortable house she&#x2019;d grown up in on a lake surrounded by woodland, but the entire region where forests and farmlands stretched like a vast Eden on either side of the wide Connecticut River. This area boasted five of the best colleges in the world, drawing students and faculty from all over the planet.<br>As a child, she&#x2019;d hiked with her family up Mount Hadley and Mount Tom, and canoed on the Connecticut River. She&#x2019;d visited Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s house several times, and heard Billy Collins speak when he was the country&#x2019;s poet laureate. She&#x2019;d contemplated modern sculpture at the art museums, and she&#x2019;d witnessed a four-point stag, branched with heavy antlers, step over their lawn and down to the lake to drink in the early-morning light.<br>She loved this area, her family, their house . . . and that was part of the problem. Perhaps she loved them too much.<br>Now, as she watched, Aaron stepped out of his Volvo. He waved at Ben as Ben backed the Cherokee out of the drive. Aaron had incredibly muscled arms and thighs, an aftereffect of wrestling in high school and college. She loved the heft of them, the safety she felt in his arms. He had dark, curly hair and wore glasses over his hazel eyes. He was her Superman, looking academic, restraining so much strength and sexuality.<br>He approached the house, tapped on the front door, and let himself in, as everyone did who knew the Barnabys well.<br>&#x201c;Hi, Aaron.&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey, Bella.&#x201d;<br>Just the sight of him made her short of breath. He pulled her to him and kissed her thoroughly.<br>She gently pushed him away. &#x201c;We should go.&#x201d; &#x201c;Right. I brought some wine. It&#x2019;s in the car.&#x201d;<br>Together they left the house, picked up the bottles of Pinot, and began walking along the narrow road winding around Dragonfly Lake. The lake was tucked in a hollow snuggled up against a gently rising mountain, or what was called a mountain in New England; in Colorado, it would be downsized to hill. It rose to a ridge running north and south, covered with evergreens, birches, and oaks, home to deer, porcupines, foxes, and numerous other creatures, including the clever raccoons that made human lives miserable if they didn&#x2019;t use the proper tight-locking trash receptacles. Various styles of houses surrounded the lake: A-frames, modernized log cabins, seventies split-levels like the Barnabys&#x2019; house, and a few fabulous minimansions like the ones on either side of the Barnabys&#x2019;.<br>All the homes looked out onto the lake, which curved in a capricious blue oval around the hill, its banks thick with grasses, forest, and wildflowers. Much of the shore was dotted with boathouses and docks, because the lake was big enough to sail on. Here and there, man-made beaches of golden sand sloped to the water. Everywhere there were trees, and over the lawns and road, the sweet green leaves of spring were casting the first delicate shadows. Tulips opened their petals to the light; pansies spilled from window boxes.<br>Aaron inhaled a deep breath of air. &#x201c;Nice day for a cookout.&#x201d; Bella nodded. &#x201c;Mmm. Funny, it usually is. The Hortons have<br>held the first neighborhood summer cookout for years.&#x201d; &#x201c;How many people will be there?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not a real crowd. Lots of these houses are just vacation homes. Like the one to the right of us&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That place is just for vacations?&#x201d; Aaron turned to look back at the house.<br>&#x201c;I know. An interior designer from Boston, Eleanor Clark, owns it. She usually comes here in the summer. I heard she loaned it to her niece this year while Eleanor goes around the world with her new boyfriend. She&#x2019;s an artist&#x2014;Natalie, not Eleanor&#x2014;about our age.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Have you met Natalie?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not yet. I think she&#x2019;ll be at the cookout. I hope so. I&#x2019;d like to meet her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see the inside of that house,&#x201d; Aaron said.<br>Bella knocked his shoulder with hers. &#x201c;Ever the architect.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>� � �<br>Natalie noticed the man when he stepped out of the Jeep parked in front of the Hortons&#x2019; house. He was a hunk, with a stern countenance that gave him an air of intelligence. Judgment. Responsibility.<br>She thought: Now there is a face I would like to paint.<br>A wide brow&#x2014;poets would call it &#x201c;noble&#x201d;&#x2014;over romantically<br>down-slanting pale blue eyes. A straight, slender nose, neat ears, a long face with a firm jaw. Wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and across the forehead, not, she figured, from laughing but from thinking. Here in the five-college area, lots of people thought for a living. The man was perhaps thirty. His hair was golden brown, like toast; she would have bet he&#x2019;d been a towheaded child.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my son,&#x201d; Louise Barnaby told Natalie. She was sitting next to Natalie, both of them in rockers on the front porch of the Hortons&#x2019; house. Louise still had to baby her leg, although she could walk on it without a cane, and Natalie had brought her a glass of chilled white wine.<br>Louise was Natalie&#x2019;s first lake friend. She&#x2019;d visited when Natalie moved into her aunt Eleanor&#x2019;s house this week, presenting her with a casserole and a vase of fresh flowers. She&#x2019;d insisted Natalie come to the cookout with Louise and her husband, Dennis, who was out on the front lawn, stabbing croquet wickets into the ground.<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s awfully cute,&#x201d; Natalie said.<br>Louise smiled. &#x201c;I know. The great thing is, he doesn&#x2019;t realize it.&#x201d; Natalie was grateful for Louise&#x2019;s company. Louise was older, but<br>still chic, her blond hair cut in a sexy shag, her trim body clad in chinos and a blue tee that brought out the azure of her eyes. Louise didn&#x2019;t look like a fifty-five-year-old who&#x2019;d given birth to four children. For that matter, Dennis was tall, slender, with lots of floppy gray hair. He still looked pretty fine as well.<br>It was shallow of Natalie to be so judgmental, she knew, but she&#x2019;d been afraid when she made the decision to move out here from Manhattan she&#x2019;d find everyone sporting Birkenstocks, feeding chickens, and discussing compost.<br>&nbsp;<br>Was she a snob? Really, she could only claim to be, at most, a wannabe snob. She didn&#x2019;t have the pedigree to be a real one.<br>Also, she was learning, there were different kinds of snobs. Here, near Amherst, Massachusetts, home of Amherst College, where the old money went, and Hampshire College, where the hip gifted went, and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where Bill Cosby and Jack Welch had gone, near Smith College, where poor, brilliant Sylvia Plath had gone, and Mount Holyoke College, where Emily Dickinson and Wendy Wasserstein had gone, the snobbery would be intellectual.<br>Natalie felt awkward in her black jeans and black silk shirt. This was about as cookoutish as her New York wardrobe got. She&#x2019;d just moved to Aunt Eleanor&#x2019;s house. She hadn&#x2019;t had time to buy different clothes yet.<br>Just for a moment, Natalie put her hand to her own head. At least her hair was growing out. Two years ago, when she had moved to Manhattan, she&#x2019;d gone to a hairdresser and had it all chopped off into a severe, chic, scalp-clinging crop. It had been a part of her statement. She could still remember leaving the salon, head high and suddenly weightless, feeling the fresh air on her bare neck, knowing that now her real life was about to begin. She&#x2019;d been twenty-eight. She&#x2019;d struggled to get there. At times in her life, she&#x2019;d despaired of getting there. For years she&#x2019;d had to drop her studies to work, often two jobs, to pay for more studies, because her parents could never help her financially. If it hadn&#x2019;t been for her aunt Eleanor, she would never have made it to Manhattan.<br>She dropped her hand. As soon as she&#x2019;d decided to leave Manhattan, she&#x2019;d begun to grow her hair out. Already dark curls clustered over her ears.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready!&#x201d; Morgan called. &#x201c;Shall I fasten Petey in his stroller?&#x201d; Her husband was in his study, tapping frantically at the com-<br>puter. A sunny Saturday afternoon, and he was working. &#x201c;Josh?&#x201d; She tried not to sound waspish. &#x201c;The cookout.&#x201d; &#x201c;Coming.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Morgan took a deep breath. During the past year, she&#x2019;d learned to achieve feats of patience she never before dreamed possible. First of all, her adorable boy, just a year old, had taught her a whole new range of deep breathing. Then Josh had taken this job with Bio-Green Industries&#x2014;and she had wanted him to take it, she had encouraged him to take it&#x2014;and suddenly her husband was too busy to haul out the trash, give her a hug, or notice their child.<br>Although they did have their house. Their amazing, slightly overwhelming, new house.<br>The O&#x2019;Keefes&#x2019; home was on the shores of Dragonfly Lake. It rose in its concrete-and-glass glory, modern, boxy, space-age. They were able to afford it because the couple who built it had to move to Spain and needed a quick sale. And, of course, because Josh&#x2019;s new job paid so well. They didn&#x2019;t love the house, but the location was sublime. A beachfront with sand for Petey to play on. A wilderness to hike in. Morgan and Josh enjoyed kayaking, canoeing, swimming, and dreamed of teaching their children all that and more in the clear, pure waters of this lake. Before the move, they&#x2019;d been living in a condo on the outskirts of Boston, commuting to jobs on crowded expressways, not getting home until late, too tired to enjoy life, and completely uninspired by the views of malls, highways, and office buildings out their condo windows. This place had seemed like a little corner of heaven to them.<br>Sometimes, though, to Morgan, it was just a bit like the top circle of hell.<br>Morgan was a scientist, a hazardous materials expert. Until recently she&#x2019;d worked in the biosafety department at Weathersfield College outside Boston. She was really good at her work. It challenged her, used all her mental and interpersonal skills; it gave her a sense of accomplishment, of keeping things safe in a turbulent world.<br>Since Josh had joined Bio-Green, Morgan&#x2019;s life required a whole new set of skills.<br>First of all, since Ronald Ruoff, CEO of BGI, Bio-Green Industries, was Josh&#x2019;s new boss, paying Josh a salary he&#x2019;d never even dreamed of before, it was incumbent upon Morgan to make nice to Josh&#x2019;s boss and his wife, Eva.<br>&nbsp;<br>Morgan had made nice. She and Josh had gone out to dinner last week with Ronald and Eva, and Morgan had been as charming as she could be, which frankly was a big fat private pain for Morgan. She didn&#x2019;t like to do charming, and she really didn&#x2019;t like to pretend interest in vapid Eva&#x2019;s frivolous enthusiasms: massages, pedicures, shopping, and whether Kate Middleton was truly suitable for Prince William; Eva&#x2019;s personal and lengthy opinion was that Kate was beneath him, and she didn&#x2019;t even get how her statement was funny. Morgan didn&#x2019;t understand how a woman perhaps only a decade older&#x2014;Morgan was thirty, Eva somewhere in her forties, already Botoxed and face-lifted&#x2014;could be so insipid. Especially with a husband like Ronald, who might not be the most debonair dog in the kennel but at least was interested in saving the world. Or, more realistically, in making money while saving the world.<br>Morgan had hoped&#x2014;she had fiercely hoped&#x2014;that she would like Eva, that they would have interests in common, that they would make plans to get together, because even though her toddler, Petey, was the beating center of her heart, Morgan was quietly and sweetly going out of her mind being a stay-at-home mommy. But if she had to spend more time with Eva Ruoff, she&#x2019;d hang herself. Okay, that was a bit dramatic, she&#x2019;d never want to leave Petey, or Josh either, even though these days Josh annoyed her no end. Was she going nuts?<br>Josh came into the living room, where Petey was babbling to himself as he swept his books off the coffee table and Morgan stood lost in her thoughts.<br>&#x201c;Th...</p><h2>Christianity for the Rest of Us: How the Neighborhood Church Is Transforming the Faith</h2><p><p> For decades the accepted wisdom has been that America's mainline Protestant churches are in decline, eclipsed by evangelical mega-churches. Church and religion expert Diana Butler Bass wondered if this was true, and this book is the result of her extensive, three-year study of centrist and progressive churches across the country. Her surprising findings reveal just the opposite&#x2014;that many of the churches are flourishing, and they are doing so without resorting to mimicking the mega-church, evangelical style. </p> <p> <i>Christianity for the Rest of Us</i> describes this phenomenon and offers a how-to approach for Protestants eager to remain faithful to their tradition while becoming a vital spiritual community. As Butler Bass delved into the rich spiritual life of various Episcopal, United Methodist, Disciples of Christ, Presbyterian, United Church of Christ, and Lutheran churches, certain consistent practices&#x2014;such as hospitality, contemplation, diversity, justice, discernment, and worship&#x2014;emerged as core expressions of congregations seeking to rediscover authentic Christian faith and witness today. </p> <p> This hopeful book, which includes a study guide for groups and individuals, reveals the practical steps that leaders and laypeople alike are taking to proclaim an alternative message about an emerging Christianity that strives for greater spiritual depth and proactively engages the needs of the world. </p></p><p><p>Diana Butler Bass is the author of eight books on American religion, including <em>Christianity After Religion</em>, <em>Christianity for the Rest of Us</em>, and <em>A People's History of Christianity</em>.

Think again, says Butler Bass (<i>The Practicing Congregation</i>) in this challenging and hopeful book, which summarizes the findings of a three-year study funded by the Lilly Endowment. Yes, many mainline churches are struggling, but not because liberal Christianity is a contradiction in terms. Rather, the old neighborhood Protestant church has fallen on hard times because the old neighborhood has been replaced by a strip mall. And many mainline churches are thriving. Butler Bass showcases 10 of them, including Redeemer UCC in New Haven, Conn., and Saint Mark (Lutheran) in Yorktown, Va. She then examines 10 practices, from hospitality to worship to vigorous theological discussion, and posits that these practices are the heartbeat of vital mainline churches.

He was the third child of Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie (who took the name of Dumas), a nobleman who distinguished himself as one of Napoleon's most brilliant generals, and Marie-Louise-Elisabeth Labouret. Following General Dumas's death in 1806 the family faced precarious financial circumstances, yet Mme. Dumas scrimped to pay for her son's private schooling. Unfortunately he proved an indifferent student who excelled in but one subject: penmanship. In 1816, at the age of fourteen, Dumas found employment as a clerk with a local notary to help support the family. A growing interest in theater brought him to Paris in 1822, where he met Fran�ois-Joseph Talma, the great French tragedian, and resolved to become a playwright. Meanwhile the passionate Dumas fell in love with Catherine Labay, a seamstress by whom he had a son. (Though he had numerous mistresses in his lifetime Dumas married only once, but the union did not last.) While working as a scribe for the duc d'Orl�ans (later King Louis-Philippe) Dumas collaborated on a one-act vaudeville, <i>La Chasse et l'amour</i> ( The Chase and Love, 1825). But it was not until 1827, after attending a British performance of <i>Hamlet,</i> that Dumas discovered a direction for his dramas. 'For the first time in the theater I was seeing true passions motivating men and women of flesh and blood,' he recalled. 'From this time on, but only then, did I have an idea of what the theater could be.'<br><br>Dumas achieved instant fame on February 11, 1829, with the triumphant opening of <i>Henri III et sa cour</i> (Henry III and His Court). An innovative and influential play generally regarded as the first French drama of the Romantic movement, it broke with the staid precepts of Neoclassicism that had been imposed on the Paris stage for more than a century. Briefly involved as a republican partisan in the July Revolution of 1830, Dumas soon resumed playwriting and over the next decade turned out a number of historical melodramas that electrified audiences. Two of these works&#x2014;<i>Antony</i> (1831) and <i>La Tour de Nesle</i> (The Tower of Nesle, 1832)&#x2014;stand out as milestones in the history of nineteenth-century French theater. In disfavor with the new monarch, Louis-Philippe, because of his republican sympathies, Dumas left France for a time. In 1832 he set out on a tour of Switzerland, chronicling his adventures in <i>Impressions de voyage: En Suisse</i> ( Travels in Switzerland, 1834-1837); over the years he produced many travelogues about subsequent journeys through France, Italy, Russia, and other countries.<br><br>Around 1840 Dumas embarked upon a series of historical romances inspired by both his love of French history and the novels of Sir Walter Scott. In collaboration with Auguste Maquet, he serialized <i>Le Chevalier d'Harmental</i> in the newspaper Le Si�cle in 1842. Part history, intrigue, adventure, and romance, it is widely regarded as the first of Dumas's great novels. The two subsequently worked together on a steady stream of books, most of which were published serially in Parisian tabloids and eagerly read by the public. He is best known for the celebrated d'Artagnan trilogy&#x2014;<i>Les trois mousquetaires</i> ( The Three Musketeers, 1844), <i>Vingt ans apr�s</i> (Twenty Years After, 1845) and <i>Dix ans plus tarde ou le Vicomte de Bragelonne</i> ( Ten Years Later; or The Viscount of Bragelonne, 1848-1850)&#x2014;and the so-called Valois romances&#x2014;<i>La Reine Margot</i> (Queen Margot, 1845), <i>La Dame de Monsoreau</i> ( The Lady of Monsoreau, 1846), and <i>Les Quarante-cinc</i> ( The Forty-Five Guardsmen, 1848). Yet perhaps his greatest success was <i>Le Comte de Monte Cristo</i> ( The Count of Monte Cristo), which appeared in installments in Le Journal des debats from 1844 to 1845. A final tetralogy marked the end of their partnership: <i>Mmoires d'un medecin: Joseph Balsamo</i> ( Memoirs of a Physician, 1846-1848), <i>Le Collier de la reine</i> ( The Queen's Necklace, 1849-1850), <i>Ange Pitou</i> ( Taking the Bastille, 1853), and <i>La Comtesse de Charny</i> ( The Countess de Charny, 1852-1855).<br><br>In 1847, at the height of his fame, Dumas assumed the role of impresario. Hoping to reap huge profits, he inaugurated the new Theatre Historique as a vehicle for staging dramatizations of his historical novels. The same year he completed construction of a lavish residence in the quiet hamlet of Marly-le-Roi. Called Le Ch�teau de Monte Cristo, it was home to a menagerie of exotic pets and a parade of freeloaders until 1850, when Dumas's theater failed and he faced bankruptcy. Fleeing temporarily to Belgium in order to avoid creditors, Dumas returned to Paris in 1853, shortly after the appearance of the initial volumes of <i>Mes Memoires</i> ( My Memoirs, 1852). Over the next years he founded the newspaper Le Mousquetaire, for which he wrote much of the copy, as well as the literary weekly <i>Le Monte Cristo,</i> but his finances never recovered. In 1858 he traveled to Russia, eventually publishing two new episodes of <i>Impressions de voyage: Le Caucase</i> (Adventures in the Caucasus, 1859) and <i>En Russie</i> (Travels in Russia, 1865).<br><br>The final decade of Dumas's life began with customary high adventure. In 1860 he met Garibaldi and was swept up into the cause of Italian independence. After four years in Naples publishing the bilingual paper L'Independant/L'Indipendente, Dumas returned to Paris in 1864. In 1867 he began a flamboyant liaison with Ada Menken, a young American actress who dubbed him 'the king of romance.' The same year marked the appearance of a last novel, <i>La Terreur Prussiene</i> (The Prussian Terror). Dumas's final play, Les Blancs et les Bleus (The Whites and the Blues), opened in Paris in 1869.<br><br>Alexandre Dumas died penniless but cheerful on December 5, 1870, saying of death: 'I shall tell her a story, and she will be kind to me.' One hundred years later his biographer Andre Maurois paid him this tribute: 'Dumas was a hero out of Dumas. As strong as Porthos, as adroit as d'Artagnan, as generous as Edmond Dantes, this superb giant strode across the nineteenth century breaking down doors with his shoulder, sweeping women away in his arms, and earning fortunes only to squander them promptly in dissipation. For forty years he filled the newspapers with his prose, the stage with his dramas, the world with his clamor. Never did he know a moment of doubt or an instant of despair. He turned his own existence into the finest of his novels.'From Alexandre Dumas, a precise and candid description of his particular view of history:<br>I start by devising a story. I try to make it romantic, moving, dramatic, and when scope has been found for the emotions and the imagination, I search through the annals of the past to find a frame in which to set it; and it has never happened that history has failed to provide this frame, so exactly adjusted to the subject that it seemed it was not a case of the frame being made for the picture, but that the picture had been made to fit the frame.<br><br>This is the point of view of the historical novelist, who approaches the past as theater&#x2013;the unending melodrama of saints and sinners, and who knows that history, eternally surprising, inspiring, disheartening, sometimes described as &#x201c;one damn thing after another,&#x201d; will never fail him. It is all there. And it is all there to be used.<br>Dumas was in his early forties when he wrote The Three Musketeers, an age when novelists are believed to be entering their best creative years. He is traditionally described as &#x201c;a man of vast republican sympathies,&#x201d; which, in contemporary terms, made him a believer in democracy, equality, and the rights of man. He had fought in the streets of Paris during the July revolution of 1830; would man the barricades in 1848; would aid Garibaldi, with guns and journalism, in the struggle for Italian independence in 1860.<br><br>Such politics came to him by inclination, and by birth. His father, Thomas-Alexandre Davy de La Pailleterie, had taken the name of his African slave mother, Marie Dumas, and spent the early years of his life on the island of Santo Domingo. When the French Revolution made it possible for men without wealth or social connections to rise to power, the soldier Alexandre Dumas became General Alexandre Dumas, commanding the Army of the Alps in 1794, serving under Napoleon Bonaparte in Italy, and later in Egypt. But his relationship with Bonaparte deteriorated; his health was destroyed by two years in an Italian prison; and he died, a broken man, in 1806. His son, in time the novelist Dumas, was then four years old, but he would be told of his father&#x2019;s life, and he knew what it meant.<br><br>By 1844, France was ruled by Louis-Philippe, duc d&#x2019;Orleans, a constitutional monarch known as &#x201c;the bourgeois king,&#x201d; who presided over the golden age of the French bourgeoisie, a propertied class animated by the slogan &#x201c;Enrichissez-vous!&#x201d; (Enrich yourselves!) This was a period of transition, when corrupt capitalism was opposed by passionate idealism&#x2013;the age of monarchy was dying, the age of democracy was just being born. The best insight into the period is to be found in the novels of Honor� de Balzac&#x2013;Dumas&#x2019;s fierce literary rival. Balzac was virtually the same age as Dumas, and, like Dumas, rose from social obscurity and penury by producing a huge volume of work at an extraordinary pace. But Balzac wrote about contemporary life&#x2013;the vanity, corruption and sexual politics of Paris in the 1840s&#x2013;and was, throughout his fiction, essentially a novelist of vice. Dumas, on the other hand, was a novelist of virtue, though he had to go back two hundred years to find it.<br><br>Setting The Three Musketeers in the year 1625&#x2013;at that distance, a contemporary American novelist might use the revolution of 1776&#x2013;Dumas was summoning up a remote and heroic era. Yes, it was all different back then. Better. Still, it may be worth remembering that Dumas&#x2019;s musketeers are proud, courageous men, men without inherited money or the support of prominent family, who must fight their way through a world of political intrigue dominated by predatory, immoral people who scheme and connive, who will do virtually anything, to keep their wealth and position. So, if it is about anything, The Three Musketeers is about betrayal, fidelity, and, like almost all genre fiction, it is about honor. Honor lost, honor gained, honor maintained at the cost of life itself. By 1894, the sale of Dumas&#x2019;s works totaled three million books and eight million serials.<br><br>The Three Musketeers, the first book of the d&#x2019;Artagnan trilogy, with Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne to follow, appeared in installments in the journal Le Si�cle from March to July in 1844. It was written with help of a collaborator, Auguste Maquet, who also participated in the writing of The Count of Monte Cristo. Maquet would later claim significant authorship, and haul Dumas into court.<br><br>Dumas was accused, as well, of plagiarism, having used The Memoirs of Monsieur d&#x2019;Artagnan, by one Courtilz de Sandras, published in Cologne in 1701, as source material. There he found not only d&#x2019;Artagnan but Athos, Porthos, and Aramis; Tr�ville and his musketeers; Milady and her maid; and the Cardinalist Guards. From the annals of French history, he took the machinations, real or reputed, involving Louis XIII, Anne of Austria, Cardinal Richelieu, and the duke of Buckingham. Then he threw out whatever reality he found inconvenient and wrote what he liked.<br><br>In the real world of Europe in 1625, the continent was being torn apart by the Thirty Years War&#x2013;a rather pallid name that obscures the cruel and brutal nature of its reality. Fighting on behalf of royal houses in conflict over religious issues and rights of succession, mercenary armies were paid by the right of pillage and ravaged the countryside, a strategy described as &#x201c;war supports the war.&#x201d; In France, French Catholics suppressed a French Protestant minority, the Huguenots, who were supported by English Protestant money and arms. Serving as virtual regent for a weak king Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu was perhaps the greatest political figure of his time. Famously eloquent, determined and brilliant, Richelieu was a deeply ambitious man, but a devoted and faithful servant of king and country.<br><br>A popular novelist, however, must produce an archvillain, and Dumas gave the job to Richelieu. As the servant of Dumas&#x2019;s fictional requirements, Richelieu is merely political on the surface, as he undertakes a series of intrigues in a struggle for power with the king or with his English Protestant enemy, Buckingham. In The Three Musketeers, Richelieu is discovered to have deeper motives, a lust for revenge inspired by a romantic slight&#x2013;a spurned advance&#x2013;and, in general, by sexual jealousy. The cardinal, according to Dumas, was in love with the queen, Anne of Austria. The reader of 1844, hurrying off to buy this week&#x2019;s chapter in Le Si�cle, likely suspected as much.<br><br>Serialized fiction read as a novel can, at times, be a slightly bumpy ride. The twists and turns of the story are intended not only to keep the reader reading, but to keep the reader buying. Thus the plot tends toward precipitous dives and breathtaking ascents, as peril and escape follow each other at narrow intervals, characters disappear and are brought back to life, and what seemed like the central crisis of the narrative is suddenly resolved, to be replaced by a second crisis.<br><br>The perfidious Cardinal Richelieu is a good example of this principle at work. He&#x2019;s a useful �minence grise at the beginning of the novel, as Cardinalist guards fight the king&#x2019;s faithful musketeers. But, when it&#x2019;s time for the story to end, he&#x2019;s too historical a figure to be vanquished with all the force that the conclusion of a romantic adventure demands. Thus the role of villain is shifted to Milady; the story can then take its chilling and violent turn; and justice, when it is at last achieved, can be, to say the least, severe.<br><br>Since writers of serials wrote for a weekly deadline, there was no such thing as regret or revision, and the reader may see rather more of the novel&#x2019;s scaffolding than the author would like. Dumas, characteristically, solved this problem with talent, and produced the best writing in The Three Musketeers in the latter third of the novel, for example the combination of battle and picnic at the Bastion Saint Gervais, during the attack on the Protestant stronghold at La Rochelle. This is easily one of the most insouciant scenes in all of literature, as the musketeers, intent on winning a tavern bet, occupy the bastion; sip wine; discuss matters of love and strategy; push a wall over on a raiding party; use the dead as mock defenders; and, finally, after four-hundred pages of action and intrigue, actually fire muskets!<br><br>This is but one pleasure among many. There is, throughout The Three Musketeers, a vast and magnanimous intelligence at work. The critic Jules Michelet described Alexandre Dumas as &#x201c;an inextinguishable volcano,&#x201d; and &#x201c;one of the forces of nature.&#x201d; He was certainly that. Born to write, and born to write about mythic times and mythic deeds, Dumas loved his characters and the elaborate story he fashioned for them. This is a telling trait in a novelist, the reader instinctively feels it, so gives himself to the story, lives in the time and place of its setting, and escapes, as surely as d&#x2019;Artagnan ever escaped, from the drone of daily existence. That&#x2019;s the job of romantic fiction and it&#x2019;s done in The Three Musketeers on virtually every page. &#x201c;All for one, and one for all!&#x201d; And all for us.</p><h2>Strategic Healthcare Management: Planning and Execution, Second Edition</h2><p>&nbsp;<strong>Instructor Resources: </strong>Test bank, PowerPoint slides for each chapter, answers to the chapter questions, and suggestions for presenting and discussing the cases.<br>A healthcare organization&#x2019;s mission should direct its strategies.

Practice Doctorate, and Research Doctorate Programs in Nursing, is a first-of-its-kind report by the NLN Education Competency Work Group, which collaborated over a two-year period to evaluate how best to prepare graduates of nursing programs across the academic spectrum to function in an evolving, dynamic health care environment. This document lays the foundation for ensuring that all United States nursing programs can expand and develop while maintaining the highest standards of quality and excellence.<br>Nurse educators examined program outcomes and competencies across all types of programs &#x2014; rather than looking at each program type in isolation from others, as has been the case. Such a wide-ranging, inclusive approach serves to clarify concepts that cut across all program types while clarifying the unique focus of each program type in relation to each concept. The group from education and practice, therefore, reviewed existing literature, work previously completed by NLN advisory councils and task groups, and emerging national concerns and initiatives to formulate outcomes and competencies. They vetted these with the nursing education community and finalized a set of outcomes and competencies that address all program types. The result is a comprehensive document that is both contemporary and futuristic and fills a gap in the existing body of scholarly research. It helps nurse educators to build curricula, further the science of nursing education, and expore and refine teaching, learning and evaluation.</p><p>National League <i>for</i> Nursing</p><h2>Estimating in Building Construction (What's New in Trades &amp; Technology)</h2><p><p> <i>For beginning to intermediate courses in cost estimating and construction estimation.<br> </i> <b> <br>The only complete, up�-to-�date guide to estimating modern building construction projects<br> </b> <i> <b>Estimating in Building Construction</b> </i> covers all the skills the beginning student needs to estimate simple to moderately complex commercial and residential buildings.

All seven books in her Vanishing Cultures series of photo-essays for children were recognized as Notable Social Studies Trade Books for Young People. Reynolds is also an avid skier, mountain climber, and adventurer.Grade 3-6-Appealing full-color photographs and a simple but descriptive text introduce the traditional values and customs of an Inuit family living on an inlet of Hudson Bay. An introduction and an "About This Book" section provide additional information about the Qamanituaq people. The photographs capture the colors and feel of the Arctic land and these Eskimo people engaged in traditional activities. While many of the pictures are identified, some are uncaptioned, although they are indirectly defined by the accompanying narrative. Numerous Eskimo words, printed in italics, are defined. Fishing, hunting, skin cleaning, sewing clothing, customs, building an igloo, and drum dancing are described through the eyes of a young girl and her family. Reynolds shows respect for and sensitivity to the traditional life style. This title makes a unique addition to similar information covered in Russell Kendall's Eskimo Boy (Scholastic, 1992) and Diane Hoyt-Goldsmith's Arctic Hunter (Holiday, 1992), both of which are told from the perspective of boys. Although the scope is slim compared to Bobbie Kalman and William Belsey's An Arctic Community (Crabtree, 1988), J.H. Smith's Eskimos (1987), or Elizabeth Hahn's The Inuit (1990, both Rourke) by this book's focus on the relationship of the Inuits to their natural surroundings and the loss of traditional ways to the influence of foreigners who have come to the land, make this title a worthwhile purchase.<br><i>Roz Goodman, Bering Strait School District Media Center, Unalakleet, </i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Secret Journeys of a Lifetime: 500 of the World&#39;s Best Hidden Travel Gems</h2><p>The latest in the highly successful <i>Journeys of a Lifetime</i> series and the sequel to the original bestseller<i>, Secret Journeys of a Lifetime </i>offers in-depth site descriptions; dozens of fun, themed top ten lists; locator maps; illuminating sidebars; and oversized, lavish full-color images that bring to life 500 novel destinations that have managed to fly under the radar.<br> &nbsp;<br> Divided into themed chapters, the book features the "World at Your Feet", "Last Wildernesses", "Island Getaways", "The Road Less Traveled", "Secret History", "Spiritual Havens", "Hidden Treasures", "Undiscovered Villages", and "City Secrets".

Solol� Market, Guatemala<br> Red with white stripes is the dominant fashion among sellers and customers at this weekly market in the Guatemalan highlands. Many women arrive with sacks on their heads filled with goods ranging from tortillas to live chickens as well as the handwoven costumes of the Kaqchikel Indians. There is barely a tourist trinket in sight, and traditional dress is the rule.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. La Vega Central, Santiago, Chile <br> The Chilean capital&#x2019;s joyously chaotic La Vega Central market, beside the Mapocho River, positively drips South American culture. For the less squeamish&#x2014;and the large stray dog, cat, and fly population&#x2014;pigs&#x2019; heads, tripe, and intestines are a draw. Other delicacies on offer include sopaipillas (fried pumpkin bread), caldo pata (hoof soup), and pastel de choclo (corn pie).<br> &nbsp;<br> 3. Namdaemun Market, Seoul, South Korea<br> South Korea&#x2019;s largest traditional market, Namdaemun&#x2014;&#x201c;great south gate&#x201d;&#x2014;owes its name to its location near a former gate in Seoul&#x2019;s long gone city wall. More than 1,000 stores and stalls purvey an array of produce, including clothes, flowers, ginseng products, street food, leather goods, toys&#x2014;and live turtles.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Flower, Bird, Fish, and Insect Market, Beijing, China <br> Chirruping canaries, caterwauling kittens, and chirping crickets create a quintessentially Chinese sound track at Beijing&#x2019;s Guan Yuan Hua Niao Yu Chong Shi Chang (Flower, Bird, Fish, and Insect Market). Shoes, scorpions, and smoking pipes are among the finds, alongside kites and insects. Much of Beijing may have been sanitized in a frantic rush to modernize, but this old-style market remains refreshingly authentic.<br> &nbsp;<br> 5. Grand Bazaar, Kashgar, China <br> Two thousand years of history have not dented exotic Kashgar&#x2019;s importance as a market town on the ancient Silk Road. Its Grand Bazaar has long attracted merchants from throughout Central Asia and western China, trading in livestock, carpets, handicrafts, clothes, and food. Barter remains common.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> 6. Pak Khlong Talat, Bangkok, Thailand<br> Head from Memorial Bridge toward Bangkok&#x2019;s Chinatown and your nose will guide you to the city&#x2019;s largest wholesale flower, spice, fruit, and vegetable market, open round the clock. Orchids, jasmine, roses, and myriad other eruptions of color and fragrance compete for visual and olfactory attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> 7. Mercato della Pignasecca, Naples, Italy <br> At its brash best, Naples is one of Italy&#x2019;s most exuberant cities. A superb place to experience its vibrant soul and top-notch street food is the Pignasecca Market. Culinary favorites include calzone, panzerotti (potato croquettes), taralli (Italian-style pretzels), pizza fritta (deep-fried pizza), and sfogliatelle (filled pastries).<br> &nbsp;<br> 8. Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Provence, France <br> This island in the fast-flowing Sorgue River was once a water- milling center producing silk, wool, and paper. The traditional industries went into decline in the 1960s, and a new one arose: Antiques-selling. The town now has more than 300 permanent antiques dealers, and its flea market is France&#x2019;s largest outside Paris. Musicians create a carnival mood on market days, while stalls sell Proven�al food and handicrafts.<br> &nbsp;<br> 9. Mercado da Ribeira, Lisbon, Portugal <br> Founded in 1882 and housed in its current riverside building since 1930, this is Lisbon&#x2019;s largest food market. On the ground floor, stalls sell everything from fish and seafood to flowers, meat, fruit, and vegetables, while the upper story is a center for local art and gastronomy. Star buys include honey and hand- painted tiles, a Portuguese specialty.<br> &nbsp;<br> 10. Souk des Ch�chias, Tunis, Tunisia <br> Dedicated to the ch�chia, a felt skullcap with tassels or a tuft, this suq (market) full of 19th-century shops is perhaps the most interesting&#x2014;yet endangered&#x2014;in Tunis. Traditionally associated with Andalusian Moors exiled from Spain between 1609 and 1614, the handmade ch�chia became part of the Tunisian national costume. Nowadays, a mere handful of craftsmen remains.<br> &nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>The Welsh Fairy Book (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>As a schoolmaster in South Wales, folklorist W. Jenkyn Thomas was dismayed to find that his students &#x2014; who took such delight in the fairy stories of other nations &#x2014; knew nothing at all of their own country's rich heritage of fairy tales. To fill the need for a collection of Welsh fairy tales for young readers, he compiled this definitive treasury.<br>Abounding in phantoms, fairies, witches, magical spells, and other time-honored fairy-tale ingredients, the 83 fascinating stories include "Lady of the Lake," in which a young country boy falls in love with a beautiful girl who agrees to marry him under very strange conditions; "The Adventures of Three Farmers," and "The Fairy Wife," in which fairies outsmart mortals; and a wealth of other fanciful, imaginative tales. Among these are such favorites as "Elidyr&#x2019;s Sojourn in Fairy-Land," "Pergrin and the Mermaiden," "The Cave of the Young Men of Snowdonia," "Goronwy Tudor and the Witches of Llanddona," "A Strange Otter," "Nansi Llwyd and the Dog of Darkness," "The Bride from the Red Lake," "Lowri Dafydd Earns a Purse of Gold," and many more. Overflowing with charm, whimsy, and authentic Welsh flavor, this stimulating collection is sure to delight not only children but also fairy- and folk-tale lovers of all ages.</p><p>William Jenkyn Thomas (1870 - 1959) was a Welsh author.

All Rights Reserved.<br><br><p>Preface</p><p>I first heard about Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s steamer trunk of fishing tackle, the lost treasure chest at the heart of this novel, from his oldest son, Jack. Jack and I were contributing editors for <i>Field &amp; Stream </i>some thirty-odd years ago, and though not close friends, we shared a river from time to time. It was a blustery November day, easy to recall be- cause all November days on British Columbia&#x2019;s Thompson River are blustery, and we were the only fishermen along a stretch of the river known as the Graveyard, just down the hill from the old white crosses where all the graves face north. On toward dark, Jack hooked a steel- head of fifteen or sixteen pounds, which I landed for him in the tailout after a long fight. We admired this great seafaring trout for a few seconds before releasing it, and celebrated with a thermos cup of hot chocolate into which I laced peppermint schnapps, in honor of my father.</p><p>After toasting the fish, I asked Jack if he thought his own father would have liked this kind of fishing&#x2014;that is, wading on slippery boulders in a river haunted by the dead, casting hour after hour in miserable weather, and considering yourself lucky to hook up once every few days and manage not to drown. He said that Ernest would have enjoyed the challenge, but that he&#x2019;d lost the heart to fly fish after a steamer trunk containing all his valuable gear was stolen or lost from Railway Express in 1940, en route to Ketchum, Idaho, where he was a guest at the Sun Valley Lodge. In fact, Jack could only remember his father fly fishing once after the loss, in the Big Wood River.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was an interesting insight into the famous author&#x2019;s psyche, but at the time I was more interested in casting my own fly rod than the fate of another man&#x2019;s tackle or the sentiments it evoked.</p><p>Years passed, and I had no reason to recall the story until my wife, Gail, persuaded me to set a novel in northwestern Wyoming, where Hemingway stayed at the L Bar T Guest Ranch during five summers and falls in the 1930s, hunting, fishing, and writing. By then Jack had died and I sought to verify the details of his story with Patrick Heming- way, Ernest&#x2019;s sole surviving son, who lives in my hometown. I spoke with him at a local screening of the PBS <i>American Masters </i>series film <i>Ernest Hemingway: Rivers to the Sea</i>. Patrick was kind enough to indulge my questions and said he recalled the lost trunk, adding that it probably contained best-quality bamboo fly rods and reels ordered from the House of Hardy catalog. Hardy was the premier London maker, and Patrick remembered helping his father convert the prices from pounds sterling to American dollars.</p><p>Today, only one piece of Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s fly fishing tackle survives in good condition, a Hardy rod in a model called the Fairy that he had with him when he first went to Idaho. It is displayed at the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vermont, along with a letter to <i>Field &amp; Stream </i>that Jack wrote about the missing tackle.</p><p>As concerns the possibility that the trunk contained Hemingway treasures unrelated to piscatorial pursuits, and perhaps of far greater value, there is one way to find out.</p><p>Pour a drink, light a fire, and turn the page. I have a story to tell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p></p><h2>Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness</h2><p><p>More than half a century after Einstein first described the energetic unity of the world in his famous equation, E=mc2, we are finally beginning to understand the spiritual and mystical implications of his discovery. <i>Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness </i>is about the miraculous possibilities that emerge when we see the universe as a matrix of frozen light, the spiritual manifestation of our intuitive consciousnesses.</p> <p>In this remarkable novel, you will find a new energetic model of the body, the spirit, and the nature of the physical world.

The Family had spliced and intertwined so often over the centuries that almost all adults except one&#x2019;s own parents were called Aunt and Uncle, and all the children were lumped together as &#x201c;the cousins.&#x201d;</p><p>To the dozens and dozens of North cousins, &#x201c;town&#x201d; was a distant thing, like &#x201c;ocean&#x201d; and &#x201c;space&#x201d; and &#x201c;government.&#x201d; What did they care about such things, except that during school hours, Auntie Tweng or Auntie Uck would rap them on the head with a thimbled finger if they didn&#x2019;t come up with the right answers?</p><p>School was something the children endured in the mornings, so they could spend the afternoons learning how to create the things that commoners called fairies, ghosts, golems, trolls, werewolves, and other such miracles that were the heritage of the North family.</p><p>It was their heritage, but not every child inherited. Great-uncle Zog was notorious for muttering, &#x201c;The blood&#x2019;s too thin, the blood&#x2019;s too thin,&#x201d; because it was his considered opinion that the Norths had grown weak in the thirteen and a half centuries since the Evil One closed the gates. &#x201c;Why else do we have so many weaklings who can&#x2019;t send their outself more than a hundred yards?&#x201d; he said once. &#x201c;Why else do we have so few children who can raise a clant out of anything sturdier than pollen and dust, or heartbind with one of their clan? Why do we have these miserable drekkas like Danny in every generation? Putting them in Hammernip Hill hasn&#x2019;t made us stronger. Nothing makes us stronger.&#x201d;</p><p>Danny heard this when he was eleven, when it wasn&#x2019;t a sure thing yet that he was a drekka. Plenty of children didn&#x2019;t show any talent till they were in their teens. Or so Mama said, reassuring him; but from Great-uncle Zog&#x2019;s words Danny began to doubt her. How could it be &#x201c;plenty&#x201d; of children who showed no talent when Danny was now the only child in the Family over the age of nine who couldn&#x2019;t even figure out whether he had an outself, let alone send it out to explore. When the other kids used their outselves to spy on Danny&#x2019;s school papers and copy them, he couldn&#x2019;t even detect that they were there, let alone stop them.</p><p>&#x201c;Drive them away, can&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; demanded Aunt Lummy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the only decent student in this school, but they&#x2019;re all getting the same marks as you because you let them cheat!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how they&#x2019;re doing it,&#x201d; said Danny, &#x201c;but how can I drive them away when I can&#x2019;t see them or feel them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just make yourself big,&#x201d; said Aunt Lummy. &#x201c;Hold on to your own space. Don&#x2019;t let them crowd you!&#x201d;</p><p>But these words meant nothing to Danny, no matter how he tried to act them out, and the cheating went on until Lummy and the other Aunts who taught the school were forced to make separate tests, one for Danny and one for all the others at his grade level. The instant result was that by age twelve, Danny was soon the only student in his grade level, the others having been put back where they belonged. In the outside world, Danny would have been doing ninth grade work, two years ahead of his age.</p><p>The other kids resented him more than ever, and therefore taunted him or froze him out as a drekka. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not one of us,&#x201d; they said&#x2014;often in those exact words. During free time they refused to let him come along on any of their escapades; he was never chosen for a team; he was never told when one of the Aunts was sharing out cookies or some other treat; and he always had to check his drawer for spiders, snakes, or dog poo. He got used to it quickly, and he knew better than to tell any of the adults. What good would it do him? How much fun would he have if some adult forced the others to take him along? What kinds of pranks would they do if they had been whipped for pooing his clean clothes?</p><p>So in this idyllic world of fairies and ghosts, gods and talking animals, Danny was a profoundly solitary child.</p><p>He knew everybody; everybody was kin to him. But he had been made ashamed of everything he did well, and even more ashamed of everything he could not do, and he regarded even those of the cousins who treated him kindly as if their kindness were pity. For who could genuinely like a boy so unworthy, whose existence meant no more than this: that the bloodlines of the North family were weak and getting weaker, with Danny the weakest of them all.</p><p>The irony was that Danny had been kept as a child apart since he was born&#x2014;but for the opposite reason. His father, Alf, a Rockbrother with an affinity for pure metals, had found a way to get inside the steel of machines and make them run almost without friction, and without lubrication. It was such a useful and unprecedented skill that he had been made ruler of the Family, and was therefore renamed as Odin; but Danny called him Baba.</p><p>Danny&#x2019;s mother, Gerd, was only slightly less remarkable, a lightmage who had learned to change the color of reflected light so that she could make things nearly invisible, or hide them in shadows, or make them glow as bright as the sun. For years Alf and Gerd had been forbidden to marry by old Gyish, who was then the Odin, for fear that the joining of two such potent bloodlines might create something awful&#x2014;a gatemage, which the Norths were forbidden ever to have again, or a manmage, which all the Families were sworn to destroy.</p><p>But when Gyish retired after losing the last war, and machine-mage Alf was made Odin in his place, the Family voted almost unanimously to allow the marriage. Danny&#x2019;s birth was the result, as close to a royal child as the Norths had had in many generations.</p><p>In his early childhood, Danny was pampered by all the adults. He was the golden boy, and great things were expected of him. He had been bright as a child&#x2014;quick to read, clever with all the family languages, dextrous with his fingers, an athletic runner and leaper, curious to a fault, and clever of tongue so he could make almost anyone laugh. But as he got older, these traits could not make up for his utter lack of harmony with any of the magics of the Family.</p><p>Danny tried everything. He gardened alongside the cousins who had a way with herbs and trees and grasses&#x2014;the ones who, as adult mages, would continue to make the North farms so astonishingly productive. But the seeds he planted grew weakly, and he could not feel the throbbing pulse of a tree.</p><p>He roamed the woods with those who had a way with animals&#x2014;the ones who, if they could only form a deep bond with wolf or bear or (failing everything grand) squirrel or snake, would become Eyefriend or Clawbrother and roam the world in animal shape whenever they wished. But the creatures ran from him, or snarled or snapped at him, and he made no friends among the beasts.</p><p>He tried to understand what it meant to &#x201c;serve&#x201d; stone or water, wind or the electricity of lightning in the air. But the stones bruised his fingers and moved for him only if he threw them; the wind only blew his hair into a tangled mop; and storms and ponds left him wet, cold, and powerless. Far from being precocious, with magic he was slow. Worse than slow. He was inert, making no visible progress at all.</p><p>Yet, except for the loneliness, he didn&#x2019;t hate his life. His long rovings in the woods were a pleasure to him. Since neither tree nor animal was drawn to him, he simply ran, becoming swift and tireless, mile after mile. At first he ran only within the limits of the family compound, because the trees that guarded the perimeter would snatch at him and then give the alarm, bringing the adult Seedguards and even Uncle Poot, the only Sapkin in the Family right now, to warn him not to leave.</p><p>But during this past winter&#x2014;perhaps because the trees were dormant and less alert&#x2014;he had found three different routes that allowed him to avoid the sentinel trees entirely. He knew that as a probable drekka he was being watched&#x2014;Danny never knew when the outself of some adult might be following him. So he took different routes to these secret passageways each time. As far as he knew, he had never been seen leaving. No one had challenged him about it, at least.</p><p>Liberated now, he would run and run, miles in whatever direction he chose. And he was fast! He could cover miles and still be home by suppertime. He would only stop when he came to a highway, a fence, a house, a factory, a town, and from the shelter of the woods or hedges or weeds he would watch the drowthers go about their lives and think: I am by nature one of them. Without affinities or powers. Living by the labor of their hands or the words of their mouth.</p><p>With one slight difference: Drowthers didn&#x2019;t know they were bereft of all that was noble in the world. They had no sense of lost heritage. The North family ignored them, cared nothing about them. But if Danny tried to leave, all the Family secrets would be at risk. The stories told on dark nights, of traitors, of wars between the Westilian families, all ended the same way: Anyone who defied the Family and fled the compound without permission would be hunted down and killed.</p><p>In these twilight times Norths may not have all the power they used to have before Loki closed the gates, before the centuries of war with the other families. But they were superb hunters. Nobody evaded them. Danny knew he took his life in his h...</p></p><h2>Shy</h2><p><b>A dazzlingly beautiful book about shyness from the author of <i>Blue Chicken</i>, <i>The Story of Fish and Snail</i>, and <i>By Mouse and Frog</i>!</b><br><br>Shy loves birds. He'd love to watch them fly and hear them sing, but he's only ever read about them in books. . .until a real bird comes along. &nbsp;He's dying to meet her, but there's just one problem: &nbsp;Shy is, well, shy--so shy, in fact, that he's afraid to leave the gutter of the book. &nbsp;Can Shy overcome his fears and venture out onto the page? &nbsp;This sweetly relatable picture book from the acclaimed Deborah Freedman speaks to every child who's ever felt like hiding instead of facing the daunting world.</p><p>Deborah Freedman was shy as a child. Now she is the sometimes shy, sometimes brave author and illustrator of several books for children. She lives in a quiet house in Connecticut, where she happily reads and draws and listens to birds sing. You can learn more about Deborah at deborahfreedman.net.K-Gr 2&#x2014;In this serene, unassuming story, readers meet Shy, a giraffe who is happiest&#x2014;both figuratively and literally&#x2014;"between the pages of a book." Shy, unseen for a large portion of the tale and unidentified until its close, is exceedingly bashful and prefers to experience the world by reading. In particular, he loves books about birds, and when he encounters a beautiful songbird, he makes the brave decision to follow her. Shy's journey takes him across wondrous landscapes and introduces him to other remarkable animals, but just as he summons the courage to speak to her, she is gone, and Shy returns home, heartbroken. When the songbird reappears, Shy, in a satisfying moment of daring, calls out to her (thus identifying himself to readers as well), and the two begin a sweet friendship. The spare text works in lovely concert with the soft, muted illustrations. Composed using pencil, watercolor, and bits of colored pencil, they evoke a sense of joy and wonder. As the book opens, the images are saturated with warm tones of orange and gold, hinting at Shy's identity, and bursts of soft blue and yellow accompany the songbird's introduction. Freedman expertly shifts the color palette to express Shy's emotions and moods. In moments of bravery, exploration, and friendship, the colors brighten; when Shy struggles with his feelings of timidity, the orange tones once again seep into the pages. The subtle beauty of the art invites multiple readings. VERDICT This warm, gentle meditation on overcoming fears and making new friends is suitable for a cozy read-aloud and quiet one-on-one enjoyment.&#x2014;Lauren Strohecker, McKinley Elementary School, Elkins Park, PA</p><h2>Roald Dahl Collection 16 Books Box Set</h2><p>With striking new artwork to celebrate the Roald Dahl 100 celebrations and a keepsake slipcase featuring Quentin Blake&#39;s iconic illustrations, this 16-book collection brings together all the classic children&#39;s novels from the one and only Roald Dahl.

Set in the same locale as the previous installments in the "All the Wrong Questions" titles and starring a young Lemony Snicket investigating strange occurrences as part of his apprenticeship for a shady "secret organization," this companion book can be enjoyed by die-hard fans as well as readers new to the series.

Black-and-white illustrations highlight key details and provide a few subtle clues along the way. Though there is a narrative thread connecting the individual tales, readers can also delve into the separate cases one-by-one with equal enjoyment.

Containing hundreds of allusions and quotations from other works, &#x201c;The Waste Land&#x201d; is marked by a disjointed structure which moves between voices and imagery without a clear delineation for the reader, a hallmark of Modernist literature. Arguably Eliot&#x2019;s most famous work, the theme of the poem, as the title would suggest, is ultimately a dire one, of disillusionment, despair, and death. Also included in this collection is &#x201c;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&#x201d; a work which preceded &#x201c;The Waste Land&#x201d; having been first published in 1910. Regarded as the beginning of Eliot&#x2019;s influential period, &#x201c;Prufrock&#x201d; was considered idiosyncratic at first but with time has been recognized as an important shift in poetry from the Romantic era to the Modernist one. &#x201c;The Wasteland and Other Poems&#x201d;, which includes an additional twenty-three poems, collects some of the most pivotal works of the Modernist literary movement, which would establish Eliot as one of the most important poets of the 20th century. This edition is printed on premium acid-free paper.</p><p>After sitting through T.S. Eliot's reading of "The Waste Land," listeners may be inclined to hang up the earphones for a spell. There are no flaws to Eliot's steady-toned interpretation; in fact, his delivery is quite remarkable in its ability to match the poem's constant, somber mood. It's just that 25-plus minutes of Eliot's desolate landscapes--rendered even more real by the author's incessant tones--can wear on the emotions. <p> In addition to the full-length version of "The Waste Land," this recording includes Eliot's stirring narration of "The Hollow Men," "Sweeney Among the Nightingales," and "Macavity the Mystery Cat."

In the phenomenal national bestsellers <em>"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"</em> and <em>"What Do You Care What Other People Think?"</em> the Nobel Prize-winning physicist recounted in an inimitable voice his adventures trading ideas on atomic physics with Einstein and Bohr and ideas on gambling with Nick the Greek, painting a naked female toreador, accompanying a ballet on his bongo drums, solving the mystery of the <em>Challenger</em> disaster, and much else of an eyebrow-raising, hugely entertaining, and astounding nature. One of the most influential and creative minds of recent history, Feynman also possessed an unparalleled ability as a storyteller, a delightful coincidence celebrated in this special omnibus edition of his classic stories. Now packaged with an hour-long audio CD of the 1978 "Los Alamos from Below" lecture, <em>Classic Feynman</em> offers readers a chance to finally hear a great tale in the orator's own voice.</p><p><p><strong>Richard P. Feynman</strong> (1918&#x2013;1988) was a professor at Cornell University and CalTech and received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1965. In 1986 he served with distinction on the Rogers Commission investigating the space shuttle <em>Challenger</em> disaster.</p><p><strong>Ralph Leighton</strong> lives in northern California.</p>Anyone who writes knows how difficult it is to come up with a good title. Lynne Truss published a moderately enjoyable ramble about punctuation but somehow had the genius to call it Eats, Shoots and Leaves. John Berendt's new book is The City of Falling Angels -- certainly a haunting phrase, though still a notch below the viscerally thrilling words Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In like fashion, I'm sure the sassy titles of the two Richard Feynman volumes here gathered together helped more than a little to make bestsellers out of the tape-recorded memoirs of a physicist: Surely, You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985) and What Do You Care What Other People Think? (1988). It didn't hurt, of course, that both books were also enormously, irresistibly entertaining.<p>Twenty years on, there are three main reasons to welcome this complete edition of, as the subtitle has it, "all the adventures of a curious character." First off, it's packaged with a CD on which we can hear Feynman relating some of his serio-comic escapades at Los Alamos during the development of the atomic bomb. Nearly everyone who knew this playful and eccentric Nobel laureate seems to comment on his colloquial, self-amused, New York-y way of talking. So, as Ralph Leighton suggests in his preface: "If you listen to the CD first, you can become familiar with Feynman's voice and speaking style, and then hear him in your head as you read the book." Second, Classic Feynman rearranges the anecdotes in roughly chronological order and adds a superb foreword by the physicist Freeman Dyson and an affectionate afterword by Alan Alda (who played the Caltech scientist in the play "QED"). Dyson, in particular, underscores Feynman's place in modern physics. Despite his unexpected avocations (playing the bongos, drawing nudes, studying Mayan hieroglyphs, hanging out with showgirls in Las Vegas), "the central theme in his life was long, slow, hard work, slogging away at a difficult scientific problem with all his strength until it was solved." Feynman, emphasizes Dyson, always "took endless trouble to get the details right. He said that the job of a scientist is to listen carefully to nature, not to tell nature how to behave."</p><p>And what, you may ask, is the third reason to acquire Classic Feynman? Simple. Those old copies of his books have almost certainly been read to pieces or passed on to teenage children thinking about careers in science. You probably need a handsome, well-bound new edition. There aren't that many bestsellers of the 1980s about which one can say that.</p><p>As a boy, Richard Feynman (1918-1988) was clearly something of a young Tom Edison, and in his anecdotes one can occasionally detect the peculiar self-deprecating smugness of the naturally smart kid. In truth, though, Feynman's great trait isn't his intelligence; it's his passion to understand, his sheer doggedness, and this is what makes reading him so inspiring. Maybe we're each stuck with our own particular less-than-genius I.Q., but any of us can learn to be more determined, can learn to focus his or her energies on a difficult problem and eventually solve it. Feynman watches a dinner plate tossed vertically into the air like a Frisbee and begins to wonder about its wobble. This leads to years of research, and ultimately a Nobel Prize in physics. His sister sends him a letter written in Chinese characters -- she's studying the language -- and he goes off and learns enough Chinese calligraphy to write back, "Elder brother also speaks." (He adds, "I'm a real bastard -- I would never let my little sister score one on me.") Whether it's breaking into safes at Los Alamos (to show the need to beef up security), learning how to play in a Brazilian samba band, taking a year off to work in a biology lab on viruses or laboriously reviewing high school math textbooks, Feynman sets his life upon each task and never lets go. When one day he realizes he's yearning for a drink in the middle of the afternoon, he simply stops drinking forever. </p><p>His inquiring character was first formed by his father, who taught him that knowing the names of things wasn't the same as knowing them. The resulting independence of mind is then firmly ratified by his first wife, Arlene, the most wonderful person in this wonderful book. She and Feynman fall in love while in high school and agree to marry. But while they are engaged, Arlene is diagnosed with a fatal disease that they both know will kill her within five or six years. Feynman marries her anyway, against the wishes of both families, and loves her passionately till the end. She clearly deserves his devotion. It was Arlene, in the hospital in Albuquerque, who sends her husband pencils engraved, "RICHARD DARLING, I LOVE YOU! PUTSY." Feynman confesses to being embarrassed to use them at Los Alamos. You see, there are all these famous scientists and. . . . Incredulous, Arlene says, "Aren't you proud of the fact that I love you?" And then, without a pause, adds the words that Richard Feynman came to live by, long after Arlene was dead: "WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?"</p><p>Indeed, Feynman doesn't give a damn about propriety, convention or what Mrs. Grundy approves. When he arrives for his first teaching job at Cornell, he has trouble locating a place to stay and nearly sleeps in a pile of leaves. Years later, at an international conference, the Nobel laureate, knowing that the Hiltons and Marriotts are all booked up, happily reserves a room for a week in a rundown hotel catering mainly to prostitutes and their clients. As he once told himself as a graduate student, "You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be: it's their mistake, not my failing."</p><p>Perhaps the best example of Feynman's self-understanding lies in his attitude toward money. After some happy years at Cornell, Feynman is lured to Caltech, where he is even happier. But one day the University of Chicago offers him "a tremendous amount of money, three or four times what I was making." He writes back:</p><p>"After reading the salary, I've decided that I must refuse. The reasons I have to refuse a salary like that is I would be able to do what I've always wanted to do -- get a wonderful mistress, put her up in an apartment, buy her nice things. . . . With the salary you have offered, I could actually do that, and I know what would happen to me. I'd worry about her, what she's doing; I'd get into arguments when I come home, and so on. All this bother would make me uncomfortable and unhappy. I wouldn't be able to do physics well, and it would be a big mess. What I've always wanted to do would be bad for me, so I've decided that I can't accept your offer."</p><p> As one reads along, Feynman's own mantra-like motto rings forth again and again: "This could be interesting." The phrase echoes through his mind when he sees a beautiful Japanese girl lingering outside his hotel room or when he accepts the task of trying to understand why the Challenger blew up as it rose into space. (The last hundred pages of this omnibus recount how Feynman slowly determined what went wrong on that heartbreaking day and his reactions, largely negative, to Washington political life.) Feynman spoke most of these stories into Ralph Leighton's cassette tape recorder, and we must be grateful for his friend's care and intelligent editing. Above all, and notwithstanding all the racy and amusing anecdotes, the scientist's conversation could be mined just for its wisdom about how we might live:</p><p>"I learned from her [his mother] that the highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion."</p><p>"That's the way the world was: You worked long hours and got nothing for it, every day."</p><p>"Have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look at what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, 'Is it reasonable?' "</p><p> "Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on. It is our responsibility to leave the people of the future a free hand. . . . If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming 'This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!' we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination. It has been done so many times before."</p><p>Like Boswell's biography of Samuel Johnson or Robert Craft's diaries about Stravinsky, Classic Feynman brings a highly unusual man to vivid, blazing life. So if you somehow missed the original two books back in the '80s, here's yet one more reason to acquire Classic Feynman -- the chance to rectify your error. Good scientists, after all, learn from past mistakes. </p><p></p><p>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post. All Rights Reserved.</p></p><h2>See You Later, Alligator! (Finger Puppet Books)</h2><p>Alligator, presented in the form of an interactive finger puppet, refuses to help Crocodile with daily chores.</p><p>See you Later Alligator was a superb book and I thought the puppet idea was brilliant and it has made me want to look for more books in that type. Jack was a bit unsure as to the puppet at first and I think was quite scared so my husband and I had to introduce the book gradually to him. We needed to make him comfortable with the puppet by gaining Jack&#39;s trust and getting the alligator to talk to Jack and then encouraging him to come and stroke him. Which worked rather quickly. Jack loved the book and I have to say, so did I. The balance between text and pictures was perfect for Jack&#39;s attention span and I could read the whole book to him with ease, and without him fidgeting or getting up. The pictures were bold and colourful and had lots of things that Jack could associate with, the washing, the dinner etc etc. I think Jack will continue to learn from this book as he finds it interesting and the interaction with the puppet is a brilliant and novel idea. The alligator asks Jack where the Mummy is and where the dinner is and Jack is fascinated by it, and talks back and interacts well.--Jodie&#34;forparentsbyparents.com&#34; (10/01/2004)</p><h2>Prototyping and Modelmaking for Product Design: Second Edition (Essential reading for students and design professionals, digital processes, 3D printing, product development)</h2><p>Building prototypes and models is an essential component of any design activity. <br><br>Prototyping and Modelmaking for Product Design illustrates how prototypes are used to help designers understand problems better, explore more imaginative solutions, investigate human interaction more fully and test functionality so as to de-risk the design process.

Their struggle to survive on the open grasslands required a shift from individualism to a new form of collectivism, which forever altered the way our mind works. It changed the way we fight and our proclivity to make peace, it changed the way we lead and the way we follow, it made us innovative but not inventive, it created a new kind of social intelligence, and it led to new sources of life satisfaction.</p><p>In <em>The Social Leap</em>, William von Hippel lays out this revolutionary hypothesis, tracing human development through three critical evolutionary inflection points to explain how events in our distant past shape our lives today. From the mundane, such as why we exaggerate, to the surprising, such as why we believe our own lies and why fame and fortune are as likely to bring misery as happiness, the implications are far reaching and extraordinary.</p><p>Blending anthropology, biology, history, and psychology with evolutionary science, <em>The Social Leap</em> is a fresh and provocative look at our species that provides new clues about who we are, what makes us happy, and how to use this knowledge to improve our lives.</p></p><p><p><strong>An engrossing exploration of how the last six million years of human evolution have forged our modern lives &#x2014; from work and relationships to leadership and innovation and, above all, our quest for happiness</strong></p><p>Human psychology is rife with contradictions: We work hard to achieve our goals, but when we succeed, our happiness is fleeting compared with our efforts. We hope our friends will do well in life but can&#x2019;t help but feel jealous if they do too well. We&#x2019;re aghast at the thought of people we know being murdered, even if we despise them, but are unconcerned when our armed forces kill enemies who are strangers to us. We complain about difficult bosses but are often just as bad when we&#x2019;re in charge.<strong></strong></p><p>These inconsistencies may seem irrational, but each of them has evolved to serve a vital function in our lives. Indeed, the most fundamental aspects of our psychology were permanently shaped by the &#x201c;social leap&#x201d; our ancestors made from the rainforest to the savannah. In their struggle to survive on the open grasslands, our ancestors prioritized teamwork and sociality over physical prowess, creating an entirely new kind of intelligence that would forever alter our place on this planet.</p><p>In <em>The Social Leap</em>, leading psychologist William von Hippel traces our evolutionary history to show how events in our distant past continue to shape our lives today. From the everyday, such as why we exaggerate, to the exotic, such as why we believe our own lies, the implications are far-reaching and extraordinary.</p><p>Blending anthropology, biology, history, and psychology with evolutionary science,&nbsp;<em>The Social Leap</em>&nbsp;is a fresh, provocative look at our species that provides new clues about who we are, why we do what we do, and how to live the good life.</p><p>William von Hippel grew up in Alaska, got his B.A. at Yale and his PhD at the University of Michigan, and then taught for a dozen years at Ohio State University before finding his way to Australia, where he is a professor of psychology at the University of Queensland.

The tables were set with cream-colored damask cloths, the silver candlesticks, flatware, and crystal gleamed. They had been rented from an outside source, which had donated their use for the evening, and offered fancier options than those provided by the hotel. The plates were rimmed with gold. Silver-wrapped party favors were on the tables at each place. A calligrapher had written up the menus on heavy ecru stock, and they'd been clipped into little silver stands. The placecards with tiny gold angels on them had already been set down according to Sarah's carefully thought-out seating chart. The gold sponsor tables were at the front of the room, three rows of them in fact, with the silver and bronze tables behind them. There was a beautiful program on every seat, along with an auction catalogue and numbered paddle.<br><br> Sarah had organized the event with the same meticulous diligence and precision that she did everything, and in the way she had run similar charity events in New York. She had given every detail a personal touch, and it looked more like a wedding than a benefit, as she glanced at the cream-colored roses encircled with gold and silver ribbons on every table. They had been provided by the city's best florist at one-third of the normal cost. Saks was providing a fashion show, Tiffany was sending models to wear their jewelry and wander through the crowd.<br><br> There was an auction of high-ticket items, which included jewelry, exotic trips, sports packages, celebrity meet-and-greet opportunities, and a black Range Rover parked in front of the hotel with a huge gold bow tied on top. Someone was going to be very happy driving the car home at the end of the evening. And the neonatal unit at the hospital benefiting from the evening was going to be even happier. This was the second Smallest Angels Ball that Sarah had organized and run for them. The first one had netted them more than two million dollars, between seat prices, the auction, and donations. She hoped to make three million tonight.<br><br> The high caliber of the entertainment they were providing would help them get to their goal. There was a dance band, which would play on and off during the night. One of the other members of the committee was the daughter of a major Hollywood music mogul. Her father had gotten Melanie Free to perform, which allowed them to charge high prices for both individual seats and particularly the sponsor tables. Melanie had won a Grammy three months earlier, and her single performances like this one usually ran a million five. She was donating her performance. <br><br> All the Smallest Angels had to pick up were her production costs, which were quite high. The cost of travel, lodgings, food, and the set-up of her roadies and band was estimated to cost them three hundred thousand dollars, which was a bargain, considering who she was and the cataclysmic effect of her performance.Everyone was so impressed when they got the invitation and saw who was performing. Melanie Free was the hottest musical artist in the country at the moment and dazzling to look at. She was nineteen years old and had had a meteoric rise in the last two years, due to her consistent hits. Her recent Grammy was the icing on the cake, and Sarah was grateful she was still willing to do their benefit for free. Her greatest fear had been that Melanie would cancel at the last minute. With a donated performance, a lot of stars and singers dropped out hours before they were expected to show up. But Melanie's agent had sworn she would be there. It was promising to be an exciting evening, and the press were covering the event in force. The committee had even managed to corral a few stars to fly up from L.A. and attend, and all the local socialites had bought tickets. For the past two years, it had been the most important and productive benefit in San Francisco&#x2014;and, everyone said, the most fun to attend.<br><br> Sarah had started the benefit as a result of her own experience with the neonatal unit, which had saved her daughter, Molly, three years ago, when she was born three months premature. She was Sarah's first baby. During the pregnancy everything seemed fine. Sarah looked and felt fabulous, and at thirty-two, she assumed she wouldn't have any problems, until she went into labor one rainy night, and they couldn't stop it. Molly was born the next day and spent two months in an incubator in the neonatal ICU, with Sarah and her husband, Seth, standing by. Sarah had been at the hospital day and night, and they had saved Molly with no ill effects or resulting damage. She was now a happy, bouncy three-year-old, ready to start preschool in the fall.<br><br> Sarah's second baby, Oliver&#x2014;Ollie&#x2014;had been born the previous summer, without any problems. He was a delicious, chubby, gurgling nine-month-old now. Her children were the joy of Sarah's existence and her husband's. She was a full-time mom, and her only other serious activity was putting on this benefit every year. It took a monumental amount of work and organization, which she was good at.Sarah and Seth had met at Stanford Business School six years before, which had brought them both out from New York. They married as soon as they graduated, and stayed on in San Francisco. Seth had gotten a job in Silicon Valley, and just after Molly's birth he had started his own hedge fund. Sarah had decided not to join the workforce. She got pregnant with Molly on their wedding night, and wanted to stay home with their babies. She had spent five years working on Wall Street in New York as an analyst, before going to business school at Stanford. She wanted to take a few years off now, to enjoy motherhood full-time. Seth had done so well with his hedge fund that there was no reason for her to go back to work.<br><br> At thirty-seven, Seth had already made a considerable fortune, and was one of the brightest young stars in the heavens of the financial community, in both San Francisco and New York. They had bought a beautiful large brick house overlooking the bay in Pacific Heights, and filled it with important contemporary art: Calder, Ellsworth Kelly, de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and a handful of promising unknowns. Sarah and Seth were thoroughly enjoying their life in San Francisco. It had been easy for them to move since Seth had lost his parents years before, and Sarah's had moved to Bermuda, so their family ties to New York were no longer strong. It was obvious to everyone on both coasts that Sarah and Seth were there to stay, and they were a wonderful addition to the business and social scenes of the city. A rival hedge fund had even offered Sarah a job, but she had no desire to do anything except spend her time with Oliver and Molly&#x2014;and Seth when he was free. He had just bought a plane, a G5, and flew to L.A., Chicago, Boston, and New York often. They had a golden life that only got better year by year. Although she and Seth had both grown up in comfortable circumstances, neither of them had had the extravagant life they had now. It worried Sarah a little from time to time that maybe they were spending too much money, with a fabulous house in Tahoe in addition to their city house, and their own plane. But Seth insisted they were fine. He said that the kind of money he was making was meant to be enjoyed. And there was no question that he did.<br><br> Seth drove a Ferrari, and Sarah a Mercedes station wagon that was perfect for her with two kids, although she had an eye on the Range Rover that was going to be auctioned off that night. She had told Seth she thought it was really cute. And most of all, it was for a good cause, one they both really cared about. After all, the neonatal unit had saved Molly's life. In a less high-tech, medically sophisticated hospital, their adorable three-year-old wouldn't be alive today. It meant the world to Sarah to give back by organizing the benefit, which had been her idea. The committee turned an enormous profit over to them after the evening's expenses were paid. Seth had kicked things off for them with a two-hundred-thousand-dollar donation in both their names. Sarah was very proud of him. She always had been and still was. He was the star of her heavens, and even after four years of marriage and two children, they were very much in love. They were even thinking about trying for a third baby. She had been overwhelmed with the benefit for the past three months. They were chartering a yacht in Greece in August, and Sarah thought that would be the perfect time to get pregnant again.<br><br> Sarah walked slowly around each table in the ballroom, double-checking the names on the placecards against her list. Part of the success of the Smallest Angels Ball was that it was exquisitely run. It was a first-class event. As she made her way toward the silver tables, after checking the gold, she found two mistakes, and switched the placecards with a serious expression. She had just finished checking the last of the tables, and was going to check on the party favor bags that six of the committee members were filling to hand out at the end of the evening, when the benefit's assistant chair made her way toward Sarah across the ballroom, with an excited look. She was a beautiful, tall blonde married to the CEO of a major corporation. She was his trophy wife, had been a model in New York, and was twenty-nine years old. She had no children and wasn't planning to have any. She had wanted to be on the committee with Sarah because the benefit was such a big deal and so much fun. She'd had a ball helping Sarah put it together, and the two women got along well. Sarah's hair was as dark as Angela's was blond. Sarah had long, straight, dark brown hair, creamy skin, and huge green eyes. She was a beautiful young woman, even with her hair in a ponytail, no makeup, a sweatshirt, jeans, and flip-flops. It was just after one o'clock, and in six hours both women would be transformed. For now, they were hard at work.<br><br> "She's here!" Angela whispered with a broad grin.<br><br> "Who?" Sarah asked, resting her clipboard on her hip.<br><br> "You know who! Melanie, of course! They just arrived. I took her to her room." Sarah was relieved to note they had come in on time, on the private plane the committee had chartered to bring her and her entourage from L.A. Her band and roadies had come by commercial jet, and had already been in their hotel rooms for two hours. Melanie, her best friend, her manager, assistant, hairdresser, boyfriend, and mother, had come up in the chartered plane.<br><br> "Is she okay?" Sarah asked, looking concerned. They had gotten an advance list of everything she required, including Calistoga bottled water, low-fat yogurt, a dozen kinds of natural foods, and a case of Cristal champagne. The list was twenty-six pages long, referring to all her personal needs, her mother's food preferences, even the beer her boyfriend drank. And then there were another forty pages referring to the band, and all the electrical and sound equipment they'd need on stage. The eight-foot grand piano she required for her performance had been brought in at midnight the night before. She and the band were scheduled to rehearse that afternoon at two. Everyone else had to be cleared out of the ballroom by then, which was why Sarah was finishing her rounds at one.<br><br> "She's fine. The boyfriend is a little odd, and her mom scared me to death, but her best friend is cute. And Melanie is really beautiful and very sweet."<br><br> Sarah had had that impression the one time she spoke to her on the phone. The rest of the time, Sarah had dealt with her manager, but she had made a point of calling and thanking Melanie personally for doing their benefit. And now the big day was here. Melanie hadn't canceled in favor of a performance somewhere else, the plane hadn't crashed, they'd all arrived on time. The weather was warmer than usual. It was a sunny afternoon in mid-May. In fact it was hot and muggy, which was rare in San Francisco, and more like a summer day in New York. Sarah knew that it would break soon, but it always created a festive atmosphere in the city when the nights were warm. The only thing she didn't like about it was that someone had told her that days like this one were considered "earthquake weather" in San Francisco. They'd been teasing her about it, but she didn't like hearing it anyway. Earthquakes were the one thing that had worried her about the city since they'd moved there, but everyone assured her that they rarely happened, and when they did, they were small. In six years of living in the Bay Area, she hadn't felt one yet. So she dismissed what they had said about "earthquake" weather. She had other things to worry about right now, like their star singer and her entourage.<br><br> "Do you think I should go up to see her?" Sarah asked Angela. She didn't want to intrude, nor be rude by neglecting them. "I was going to meet her here when she comes down for rehearsal at two."<br><br> "You can just stick your head in and say hello."<br><br> Melanie and her group had two large suites, and five other rooms on the club floor, all provided on a complimentary basis by the hotel. They were thrilled to host the event, and gave the benefit committee a total of five free suites for their stars and fifteen rooms and junior suites for their VIPs. The band and roadies were on a lower floor, in lesser rooms that the committee had to pay for out of the benefit budget, which came from their profits for the night.<br><br> Sarah nodded, put her clipboard in her handbag, and checked on the women stuffing the party favor bags with expensive goodies from a variety of stores. And a moment later she was in the elevator on the way to the club floor. She and Seth had a room there too, so she used her key for the elevator. Otherwise there was no way to get to that floor. She and Seth had decided it would be easier to dress at the hotel than go home and rush back. Their babysitter had agreed to stay overnight with the kids, which made it a nice night off for Sarah and Seth. She could hardly wait till the next day, when they could lie in bed, order room service, and talk about the event the night before. But for now, she just hoped everything would go okay.<br><br> As soon as she got off the elevator, Sarah saw the huge lounge on the club floor. Pastries, sandwiches, and fruit were set out, bottles of wine, and a small bar. There were comfortable chairs, tables, telephones, a vast array of newspapers, a gigantic wide-screen TV, and two women sitting at a desk, to help guests in any way they could, with dinner reservations, questions about the city, directions, manicures, massages, whatever whim a guest could have. Sarah asked them for the directions to Melanie&#x2019;s room, and then continued down the hall. To avoid security hassles, and fans, Melanie was registered under the name Hastings, her mother&#x2019; s maiden name. They did that at every hotel, as did some of the other stars, who rarely registered in their own names.<br><br> Sarah gently knocked on the door of the suite number she&#x2019;d been given by the woman in the lounge. She could hear music inside, and a moment later the door was opened by a short, heavy-set woman in a halter top and jeans. She was carrying a yellow pad, with a pen stuck in her hair, and carrying an evening gown. Sarah guessed correctly that she was Melanie&#x2019;s assistant, whom she had also spoken to on the phone.<br><br> &#x201c;Pam?&#x201d; Sarah asked, as the other woman smiled and nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sarah Sloane. I just came to say hello.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Come on in,&#x201d; she said cheerfully, as Sarah followed her into the living room of the suite, and saw chaos all around her. Half a dozen suitcases were open on the floor, with their contents spilling everywhere.One was full of slinky...</p><h2>Carmina Burana: Choral Score</h2><p>(Misc).

Exhausted by the challenge of leading the Israelites from slavery to the Promised Land, Moses cried out to God, "What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? . . . If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me" (Exodus 11:11, 15). If that sounds hauntingly familiar to you, you may be the senior pastor of a contemporary church. The burden of Christian leadership is becoming increasingly unbearable--demanding skills not native to the art of pastoring; demanding time that makes sabbath rest and even normal sleep patterns seem extravagant; demanding inhuman levels of efficiency, proficiency and even saintliness. No wonder pastors seem and even feel less human these days. No wonder they burn out or break down at an alarming rate; no wonder the church is missing the mark on its mission. In <em>Creating a Missional Culture,</em> JR Woodward offers a bold and surprisingly refreshing model for churches--not small adjustments around the periphery of a church's infrastructure but a radical revisioning of how a church ought to look, from its leadership structure to its mobilization of the laity. The end result looks surprisingly like the church that Jesus created and the apostles cultivated: a church not chasing the wind but rather going into the world and making disciples of Jesus.</p><p><strong>JR Woodward</strong> is a church planter, activist, consultant, missiologist, speaker and writer.&nbsp;He cofounded Kairos Los Angeles and the Ecclesia Network, a relational network of missional churches. He is the director of the Solis Foundation, which partners with churches in Kenya to equip and resource people living in extreme poverty to create sustainable businesses. He blogs at jrwoodward.net."<em>Creating a Missional Culture</em> is a worthwhile read that provides a gracious, yet prophetic corrective to individualistic, pastor-centric churches, moving the missional church forward." (Jonathan K. Dodson, Evangelical Missions Quarterly, April 2013)<br><br>"<em>Creating a Missional Culture</em> is about cultural analysis, leadership formation, congregational empowerment and missional engagement. JR Woodward blends head, heart and hands to reinvigorate the church. I highly recommend this book for those studying missiology, ministry and ecclesiology." (Amos Yong, J. Rodman Williams Professor of Theology, Regent University School of Divinity)<br><br>"Many have written critiques about our consumerism, lack of discipleship, narcissism and theology, but few have given us a clear way forward. In this book, JR Woodward uses compelling theology, cultural insight, biblical wisdom and practical examples on how to shift from consumerism to mission and equip the people of God to reach their full redemptive potential. This is a real gift to the body of Christ." (Jon Tyson, pastor, Trinity Grace Church New York, author of Rumors of God)<br><br>"There is no mistaking that the missional thrust that JR Woodward unravels in his book has at its core a profound understanding of spirituality as the propellant for cultivating such culture in our ministry. While some erroneously insist on dichotomizing between missional and spiritual formation, JR makes a solid case for the necessary integration of the two. Indeed, authentic spirituality is missional through and through. JR's work accentuates this holistic approach to our distinct yet integrated calling as equippers: as an apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor or teacher." (Wil Hernandez , Ph.D., director of the Master of Arts in Spiritual Formation and Leadership at Spring Arbor University (msfl.arbor.edu), author of Henri Nouwen and Spiritual Polarities: A Life in Tension)<br><br>"JR Woodward's fresh views about leadership and church culture and his practical guides and suggestions make this a relevant and important book for every congregation. The chapters on polycentric leadership alone are worth the price of the book. <em>Creating a Missional Culture</em> delivers exactly that&#x2015;a provocative guide for the intentional, Spirit-led creation of a church culture where Christ is incarnated in the lives of individuals and communities." (Dr. MaryKate Morse, author of Making Room for Leadership)<br><br>"The church has encountered a serious gap in fulfilling its apostolic imagination. JR steps in as a visionary and provides a major breakthrough, showing us that the release of the missional church is dependent upon creating a missional culture. This book offers next steps for those of us who long to equip ordinary Christians for profoundly missional expressions of church. I wish I had written it!" (Linda Bergquist, church strategist, coauthor of Church Turned Inside Out: A Guide for Designers, Refiners, and Re-Aligners)<br><br>"I have been craving a book that would facilitate the reimagination of church culture, and it is finally here. This is a book I hope many will devour." (Dwight J. Friesen, associate professor of practical theology, The Seattle School of Theology Psychology, author of Thy Kingdom Connected)<br><br>"A decade ago, Alan Hirsch and I explored the idea that the fivefold leadership matrix was essential to unleashing the missional church. Now JR Woodward goes further by detailing how this matrix of leadership fosters a learning, healing, welcoming, liberating and thriving missional culture. This book is beautifully written and well researched, and it gets at complex issues in a readable and accessible way. This book is a gift to the missional conversation." (Michael Frost, coauthor, The Shaping of Things to Come, and author, The Road to Missional)<br><br>"JR Woodward's remarkable book defies categorization. To 'create a missional culture' requires disciplined biblical and theological formation, discerning engagement with contemporary cultures, appreciative interaction with diverse resources, and the courage to experiment and to innovate. Woodward does all that and more in this book. The growing exploration of the theology and practice of the missional church is enriched by this volume. Its authority rests in the author's tested and validated experience as an equipper 'of the missional church for the sake of the world.'" (Darrell Guder, Winters Luce Professor of Missional and Ecumenical Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary, editor and coauthor of The Missional Church: A Vision for the Sending of the Church in North America)<br><br>"JR Woodward reads widely, writes deftly and lives deeply. His book <em>Creating a Missional Culture</em> reflects all of that. Read it and explore what leading can be in the strange new worlds of mission in North America." (David Fitch, B.R.

Always uplifting, "The Catholic Girls Survival Guide for the Single Years," offers timeless truths that help women see beyond current circumstances to grasp the bigger picture of life as a beloved daughter of God. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a single Catholic woman&#x2014;or anyone who wants to learn how to love single women better.

A thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing guide for living a sane and spirited single life, women will find themselves returning to it for a needed boost of inspiration or consolation.

The directly appealing melodies, with their infinite variety and grace, and the highly evocative accompaniments, filled with graceful pianistic figures, lend these short masterpieces the rare distinction of encompassing greatness in a score of bars. <br>Schubert's three great song cycles are here reprinted directly from the definitive Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel <i>Schubert-Gesammtausgabe.</i> The volume comprises the universally known and beloved songs of <i>Die sch�ne M�llerin</i> (1823), the somber depth and picturesqueness of <i>Die Winterreise</i> (1827) and <i>Schwanengesang</i> (1828), one of Schubert's last works, a rich and masterly epilogue to the long series of his songs. Whether purely lyrical (as in "Wohin?") or creating revolutionary atmospheric effects (as in "Die Stadt" or "Der Doppelg�nger"), all of these songs show the composer to sure and powerful advantage. <br>In addition to the music and German texts, this volume also includes English translations of the texts by Henry S. Drinker, previously unavailable, that are especially designed to be sung to Schubert's melodies.</p><p>Austrian composer Franz Schubert (1797&#x2013;1828) was the first of the great Romantics. In addition to his nine symphonies, he wrote more than 600 <i>Lieder</i> (songs) as well as piano pieces, operas, and chamber music.</p><h2>Many Roads One Journey: Moving Beyond the 12 Steps</h2><p>From the author of <em>Women, Sex, and Addiction</em>, a timely and controversial second look at 12-Step programs, helping all readers to draw on the steps' underlying wisdom, adapting them to their own experiences, beliefs, and sources of strength.</p><p><br>Charlotte D.

Written for her Discalced Carmelite nuns, it is nonetheless considered Teresa's operations manual for anyone genuinely committed to the spiritual life. But by perfection she doesn't intend the futile pursuit of idealized flawlessness, as some might think. Rather, Teresa means achieving an authentic human fulfillment a true becoming of that person we are meant to be.<br><br>Offering a fresh perspective on St. Teresa's thought, Father Mark O'Keefe draws our attention to the central fact that she considers the virtues especially love of neighbor, detachment, and humility as the essential and ever-relevant foundation for her spirituality of prayer.<br><br>This very human Doctor of the Church teaches that whether in the 16th century or the 21st prayer is intimately and necessarily linked with personal transformation. Authentic prayer is never divorced from our daily living: God, Teresa reminds us, walks among the pots and pans. <br><br>With attention-catching quotations, helpful questions for personal reflection or group discussion, and its comprehensive index, The Way of Transformation is an excellent resource for any serious student of St. Teresa of Jesus and a must-read for everyone looking to explore Christian spirituality and prayer more deeply and authentically.</p><p>Mark O&#39;Keefe, OSB, is a Benedictine monk and priest of Saint Meinrad Archabbey in Indiana. He is associate professor of Moral Theology at Saint Meinrad Seminary and School of Theology and from 1996-2008 was its president-rector. Currently, in addition to teaching at Saint Meinrad, Father O&#39;Keefe is chaplain to the Discalced Carmelite nuns in Terre Haute, Indiana. He is the author of nine books, on Christian ethics, the priesthood, and Carmelite spirituality. His previous book with ICS Publications, Love Awakened by Love: The Liberating Ascent of Saint John of the Cross, was honored with a 2014 award for excellence from the Catholic Press Association of the United States and Canada. Father O&#39;Keefe s interest in Carmelite spirituality, especially its great teachers, St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila, has led him to specialized studies in Avila, Spain, over the course of several years.The Way of Transformation provides a clear and comprehensive account of the foundation and fruit of prayer, as taught by St. Teresa of Avila, ... and clearly manifests the author s giftedness in communicating his ideas to others. <br><br>Father O'Keefe's focus in this work is on exploring Teresian Carmelite spirituality through the lens of moral theology, thereby holding together the mystical and ascetical dimensions of the spiritual life.... The book strongly accentuates the fact that authentic prayer necessarily brings about personal transformation. <br><br>The author not only provides us with a masterful account of the key virtues love of neighbor, detachment, and humility within the context of Teresa's day, but, even more helpfully, he grounds them in contemporary life, demonstrating their applicability and relevance for us today. He also offers an insightful account of the particularly Teresian attitude of determination which must nurture our resolve to do God's will, not our own will, at every stage of the spiritual journey. <br><br>The Way of Transformation is a timely, practical, and welcome book. It is not only a work of information, but also a book of formation, assisting us to appropriate more deeply St. Teresa's spirituality. I certainly profited from reading it, and am sure it will similarly profit greatly all those who wish to acquaint themselves with the spirituality of St. Teresa of Avila, as well as those who are already her disciples. --Aloysius Rego, OCD; Mt.

Among other themes, the book emphasizes the importance of funds of knowledge for children&#x2019;s development and for effective partnerships with families (the knowledge that children acquire from their families) and the concept of funds of identity as a catalyst for educators to understand their own identity. Throughout the book, the authors make connections to these concepts not only to help educators understand child development, but also to show how children develop within the context of their families. <br> <br> The <b>10th Edition</b> continues to highlight important parent involvement programs and how such programs are often successful because of their asset-based view of families, particularly those that are diverse, as well as those with children with special abilities. Updated theory and research are included throughout the text, as well as new situational vignettes that illustrate typical parent-school situations.</p><p><b>Mari Riojas-Cortez </b>became interested in family engagement when she was a bilingual teacher working with young children in San Antonio, Texas. She learned early in her career that families play a very important role in children&#x2019;s development, and she developed strong relationships by welcoming families to her classroom and inviting them to participate in different aspects of their children&#x2019;s education. Mari understood what many Latino families faced because her parents faced the same cultural and linguistic barriers when they arrived in the United States from Mexico. After completing her degree in educational leadership, Mari&#x2019;s interests in early childhood education led her to The University of Texas at Austin, where she received a doctorate in curriculum and instruction with a concentration in early childhood education and bilingual education in 1998. <br> <br> Currently, she is Professor of Early Childhood Education at the University of Texas at San Antonio, where she collaborates with local school districts and early childhood agencies in various capacities. Additionally, Mari&#x2019;s work has been published in a variety of journals including <i>Journal of Early Childhood Research, International Journal of Early Childhood Education, Young Children, Early Child Development and Care, Journal of Early Childhood Teacher Education, Language Arts,</i> and the <i>Bilingual Research Journal,</i> among others. Mari Riojas-Cortez also serves as Editor for <i>Dimensions of Early Childhood </i>(a journal published by the Southern Early Childhood Association). <br> <br> <b>Eugenia Hepworth Berger </b>became interested in parent involvement when she and her husband, Glen, became the parents of three children who attended public schools.

I also think the inclusion of the discussion on child development and brain development is important; it is easy to understand... I like the discussion of the stages of parenthood.

I would strongly adopt this textbook.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014; Gwen Walter <br> <br> &#x201c;I appreciate that the discussion about family engagement is not limited to a Western definition. This is a strength... The strengths of the book are the topics covered... and the use of scenarios in the writing. Another strength is the research completed to write succinct sections on laws and programs related to young children and their families.&#x201d; <br> &#x2014; Robin Fox, University of Wisconsin-Whitewater <br> <br> &#x201c;I love that the importance of infancy is clearly stated in the chapter as this is a developmental period that often gets overlooked in its importance for setting a solid foundation for the rest of childhood... I like that different types of parental attitudes are explored and included. This will make it easier for students to think about their own parents&#x2019; level of involvement and how it influenced their own school careers... the writing style flows well and is appropriate for students.

"Not only have literature circles spread through U.S. schools," he notes, "they have taken root in schools around the world, including Japan, where there is no cultural precedent of adult reading groups to build on. In fact, some Japanese parents are now learning about book clubs from their school age kids and starting reading groups of their own.

Many of the sources have not previously appeared in print, or in books readily available to students. Volume 1 covers two major topics: the Atlantic slave trade and the European conquest. It details the beginnings of the slave trade, slavery as a business, the experiences of slaves, and the effect of abolitionism on the trade, using such documents as a letter from a sixteenth-century African king to the king of Portugal calling for a more regulated slave trade, and the nineteenth-century testimony of a South African slave accused of treason. The volume also covers the early nineteenth-century considerations of the costs and benefits of colonization, the development of conquest as the century progressed, with special attention to technology, legislation, empire, religion, racism, and violence, through such unusual documents as Cecil Rhodes's will and a chart of the costs of African animals exported to Western zoos.<br></p><p><br><strong>Willim H.

It is also, often silently, an important <br>contribution to world history...What is remarkable is that Alpers touches all the main bases and themes even in this short compass...Alpers has long been known as an East Africa, and especially Mozambique, specialist. This makes even more commendable the way he writes extensively and knowledgably on the other side of the ocean, the Bay of Bengal, the Malay world, and the South China Sea."--<em>International Journal of Maritime History</em><p></p><br>"The selection and organization of the documents is so effective that the book provides a wonderful introduction into Africa's intersection with Europe through the words of the people who lived through it. From the era of the slave trade to the establishment of the new South Africa, Africa and the West portrays Africa as a real place full of complex and interesting people and institutions, and it emphasizes that the 'Western' intersection with Africa was more than just an impact and response. People experienced, observed, critiqued, thought, planned, plotted, and dreamed. Together, the documents of this collection provide powerful evidence of the sheer level of thought, debate, struggle, and planning that went into every stage of the Africa/West experience."--<em>African Studies Quarterly</em> <br><p></p><br>"This superb collection illuminates the West's impact on Africa from 1400 to 1994.

In trying to explain who he was and how he came to be the object of others' admiration and abuse, Rousseau analyses with unique insight the relationship between an elusive but essential inner self and the variety of social identities he was led to adopt. The book vividly illustrates the mixture of moods and motives that underlie the writing of autobiography: defiance and vulnerability, self-exploration and denial, passion, puzzlement, and detachment. Above all, Confessions is Rousseau's search, through every resource of language, to convey what he despairs of putting into words: the personal quality of one's own existence.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

With an emphasis on the dynamics of the research relationship, Ruthellen Josselson artfully demonstrates the steps of a successful interview. Each step is illustrated with excerpts from interviews on diverse topics. The book describes how to structure interviews effectively, develop questions that elicit meaningful narratives, cultivate skills for empathic listening and responding, avoid common pitfalls, and deal with problems that develop in an interview.<br><br> Pedagogical Features<br> *Practice exercises adapted from Josselson's popular workshops.<br> *Annotated examples of "good" and "bad" interviews.<br> *A chapter on interviewing dos and don'ts.<br> *Appendices with interview aids, sample follow-up questions, and a sample consent form.</p><p>Ruthellen Josselson, PhD, is Professor of Clinical Psychology at Fielding Graduate University. She is a recipient of the American Psychological Association&#39;s Henry A. Murray Award and Theodore R. Sarbin Award, and is a cofounder of the Society for Qualitative Inquiry. In her numerous publications, she has explored the theory and practice of qualitative inquiry. Many of her books and articles are based on interviews. She has conducted workshops on interviewing skills for qualitative inquiry in the United States, France, Norway, Finland, Israel, and the United Kingdom."Any qualitative researcher using interviewing could benefit from this text. It is full of interesting interview examples and stories that will catch students' attention. Strengths include the emphasis on responding to research questions, examples of how to elicit details and reflection from research participants, and the attention to images and metaphors. The chapter on 'dos and don'ts' is one of my favorites."--Penny L. Burge, PhD, Department of Educational Research and Evaluation, Virginia Tech<br> <br> "This is a methodological bible for graduate students, undergraduates, and faculty members interested in conducting interviews, gathering life stories, and building a narrative intimacy with participants. Slender but deep, the volume offers respectful support to qualitative researchers so that we may venture into unsteady territory, muster the courage to be psychologically attentive and engaged, and not stumble. With a delicate braid of narrative theory, methodological guideposts, and a terrifically useful list of interview dos and don'ts, Josselson is an intellectually thrilling and methodologically wise escort for novice and experienced interviewers alike. You will want to read this book immediately, teach it, and then pull it out again when you are about to begin another project. It is classic Josselson--compelling, brilliant, and irresistible."--Michelle Fine, PhD, Doctoral Program in Psychology, The Graduate Center, City University of New York<br> <br> "Josselson's book is a gold mine for those who conduct research interviews in order to understand people's experiences on their own terms. Drawing on decades of experience as a researcher and teacher, Josselson provides practical guidance about how to carry out interviews that balance human connection with scientific inquiry. This book should be required reading for all social scientists engaged in interview research; my students will certainly be reading it!"--Harold D. Grotevant, PhD, Rudd Family Foundation Chair in Psychology, University of Massachusetts Amherst<br> <br> "A thoughtful account of how to conduct interviews that invite participants to talk. It does a wonderful job of placing the interviewer/n-/interviewee relationship front and center, something often overlooked or inadequately addressed in other books about interviewing for research. It does a terrific job of explaining the difference between interviewing for qualitative research purposes and interviewing for other reasons. I loved that the text was filled with excerpts from transcripts and that these were from interviews about a variety of topics."--Carey E. Andrzejewski, PhD, Department of Educational Foundations, Leadership, and Technology, Auburn University<br> <br> "This is a very well-presented text on conducting interviews. I particularly like the examples of difficult interviews. These examples, along with the refining questions, are major strengths of the book."--Elizabeth Monk-Turner, PhD, Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, Old Dominion University<br> &nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;In her inimitable way, Josselson captures the essence and the detail of qualitative interviewing that students in particular need. She clearly details the nature of human experience as a layered and complex manifestation of the storied or narrative nature of interaction that occurs in an interview. The excellence of Josselson's text resides in her accurate prediction of the many challenges that students will experience as they pursue the use of qualitative research interviewing methodology. In effect, she alerts students to plan for various pitfalls that can and will occur, leaving them excellently prepared with tools and strategies as they venture into their beginning participant interviews. What makes Josselson's text an outstanding teaching tool is her insistence that it is the development of the participant-researcher relationship that leads the novice researcher through the seeming quagmire of methodology and provides the key factor in obtaining rich, textured data....Josselson's excellent text provides the steps and examples necessary for students and researchers to acquire and further develop their knowledge and relational skills as qualitative researchers. She inspires students by describing many of the difficulties encountered as being reasonable expectations rather than making this aspect of qualitative research difficult to understand and master. I recommend <i>Interviewing for Qualitative Inquiry</i> for a broad audience, including novice to experienced qualitative researchers....Doctoral and postdoctoral-level researchers and educators will, in reading this text, coalesce their earlier interview experience into a coherent whole to be presented to graduate students and research fellows. Experienced quantitative researchers will find in this resource an excellent explanation of the validity of the qualitative research-interviewing methodology.&#x201d;<i> </i> (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> 2014-03-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Based on her decades of research and teaching, Josselson provides an authoritative account for conducting interviews that are self-consciously embedded in social worlds and relationships....As qualitative researchers, we share titles only of those that add to our understanding or provide new insights and modes for training the next generation. If you are a qualitative researcher, you should add Josselson's new book to that list....Includes incredibly helpful appendices....I came to think of her text as teaching students and scholars how to be &#x2018;embedded&#x2019; as interviewers: how to anticipate, listen empathetically, and make the most of the complicated social dynamics of the interview scene. One of my favorite aspects of her book is that she is also not afraid to tell novice interviewers what <i>not</i> to do....Josselson is truly a mentor and guide for up-and-coming qualitative methodologists, and that voice and her insights come across clearly in this slim and useful volume. I would recommend it for courses in psychology, education, nursing, social work, sociology, communications and related fields. Specifically, I think it will serve well in methods courses, and even as a supplementary book in any mid- to upper- level course that requires or allows undergraduates or graduates to conduct their own research. I plan to use it to prepare my advanced undergraduates when they embark on research projects of their own devising or when they are supporting my research agendas. I think it will make them more reflexive but also more confident in the moves available to them as qualitative researchers.&#x201d;<i></i> (<i>Journal of Social Psychology</i> 2014-05-21)</p><h2>Pro Cycling on $10 a Day: From Fat Kid to Euro Pro</h2><p><p>Plump, grumpy, slumped on the couch, and going nowhere fast at age 16, Phil Gaimon began riding a bicycle with the grand ambition of shedding a few pounds before going off to college.

Heiress to the Guinness fortune, Blackwood was celebrated as a great beauty and dazzling raconteur long before she made her name as a strikingly original writer. This macabre, mordantly funny, partly auto-biographical novel reveals the gothic craziness behind the scenes in the great houses of the aristocracy, as witnessed through the unsparing eyes of an orphaned teenage girl. Great Granny Webster herself is a fabulous monster, the chilliest of matriarchs, presiding with steely self-regard over a landscape of ruined lives.</p><p>Caroline Blackwood (1931-1996) was born into a rich Anglo-Irish aristocratic family. She rebelled against her background at an early age and led a hectic and bohemian life, which included marriages to the painter Lucian Freud, the pianist and composer Israel Citkowitz, and the poet Robert Lowell. In the 1970s Blackwood began to write. Among her books are several novels, including&nbsp;<i>Great Granny Webster</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Corrigan</i>&nbsp;(both available asNYRB&nbsp;Classics);&nbsp;<i>On the Perimeter</i>, an account of the women&#x2019;s anti-nuclear protest at Greenham Common; and&nbsp;<i>The Last of the Duchess</i>, about the old age of the Duchess of Windsor.<br><br>Honor Moore&#x2019;s collections of poems are&nbsp;<i>Red Shoes, Darling,</i>and&nbsp;<i>Memoir</i>. She edited&nbsp;<i>Amy Lowell: Selected Poems</i>&nbsp;for the Library of America and is author of&nbsp;<i>The White Blackbird</i>, a life of her grandmother, the painter Margarett Sargent."Shocking, brilliant, and wickedly funny,&nbsp;<i>Great Granny Webster</i>&nbsp;is Caroline Blackwood&#x2019;s best book. In the monstrous old dowager of Hove, and the ruling class she represents, Blackwood found a subject grandly commensurate with her own extraordinary style of aghast relish."&nbsp;&#x2014; Jonathan Raban<br><br>"None of us will forget Caroline Blackwood&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Great Granny Webster</i>, a matter-of-fact account&#x2014;and all the grimmer for this matter-of-factness&#x2014;of the temperamental and circumstantial misfortunes of an Ulster family. Although it&#x2019;s deceptively concise, it evokes the spirits of no less than four ages&#x2014;Victorian, Edwardian, pre- and postwar&#x2014;in exact and resonant prose...A unique literary experience."&nbsp;&#x2014; Philip Larkin<br><br>"Blackwood loves monsters. No character in modern literature is more obdurately monstrous than Great Granny Webster. An Edwardian relic, this utterly pleasureless, stingy, censorious, ossified banshee, forever ensconced in her painfully stiff chair before a fireplace laid but never lit, is the stuffed and essentially powerless dragon of a musty castle, the remnant of hidebound and pointless traditional values, someone who has never in her life given anyone a reason to like her."&nbsp;&#x2014; Gary Indiana,&nbsp;<i>Bookforum<br></i><br><i>"Great Granny Webster</i>&nbsp;feels more like a memoir than a novel...but it is as gripping as a whodunit. There are passages like passages in a strange house: when they turn a corner, something unexpectedly shocking comes into sight. It is also very funny, and the characters are vividly eccentric&#x2014;or just plain vivid: Blackwood&#x2019;s writing never merely trundles along."&nbsp;&#x2014; Gabriele Annan,&nbsp;<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></p><h2>Divine Eros: Hymns of Saint Symeon the New Theologian (Popular Patristics) (Popular Patristics, 40)</h2><p>Daniel K.

Why, then, does being kind feel so dangerous? If we crave kindness with such intensity, why is it often the last pleasure we permit ourselves? And why&#x2015;despite our longing&#x2015;are we often suspicious when we are on the receiving end of it?</p><p>Drawing on intellectual history, literature, psychoanalysis, and contemporary social theory, this brief and essential book will return to its readers what Marcus Aurelius declared was mankind's "greatest delight": the intense satisfactions of generosity and compassion.</p></p><p><p>Adam Phillips is a psychoanalyst and the author of twelve books, all widely acclaimed, including <i>On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored</i>; <i>Going Sane</i>; and, most recently, <i>Side Effects.</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Barbara Taylor has published several highly regarded books on the history of feminism, including the award-winning <i>Eve and the New Jerusalem</i>.</p><p>She and Adam Phillips both live in London.</p><p><strong>Chapter One </strong></p><p><strong><strong>Against Kindness</strong></strong></p><p>Kindness, or the lack of it, has been getting a lot of press recently. Media gurus lament the selfishness of our times, while newspapers regularly feature stories like the one about a wealthy stockbroker who, at the peak of his career, decided tospend his weekends doing volunteer work with deprived children. He was amazed at his own reaction. &#x201c;Helping kids just makes me so happy, I feel like a different person.&#x201d; His astonishment is echoed in headline reports of studies of &#x201c;what makes people happy,&#x201c; which show kindness registering much higher on the happiness scale than self-focused behavior. A recent report described an experiment carried out by the American psychologist Martin Seligman (author of Authentic Happiness), who recruited a group of university students to test out &#x201c;philanthropy versus fun.&#x201d; &#x201c;Guess which one gave them the bigger kick?&#x201d; the reporter chortled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve felt that kick too, every time I buy someone a pint.&#x201d;</p><p>Reading these stories, we began to wonder why people today are so surprised by the blindingly obvious. Why do the pleasuresof kindness astonish us? And why are stories about kindness often so corny or silly, so trivializing of the things that matter most to most people?</p><p>The pleasures of kindness were well known in the past. Kindness was mankind &#x2019;s &#x201c;greatest delight,&#x201c; the Roman philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius declared, and thinkers and writers have echoed him down the centuries. But today, many peoplefind these pleasures literally incredible or at least highly suspect. An image of the self has been created that is utterlylacking in natural generosity. Most people appear to believe that deep down they (and other people) are mad, bad, and dangerous to know; that as a species&#x2014; apparently unlike other species of animal&#x2014;we are deeply and fundamentally antagonistic to each other, that our motives are utterly self-seeking, and that our sympathies are forms of self-protection.</p><p>This book explains how and why this has come about. It shows how the kind life&#x2014;the life lived in instinctive sympathetic identification with the vulnerabilities and attractions of others&#x2014;is the life we are more inclined to live, and indeed is the one we are often living without letting ourselves know that this is what we are doing. People are leading secretly kind lives all the time but without a language in which to express this, or cultural support for it. Living according to our sympathies, we imagine, will weaken or overwhelm us; kindness is the saboteur of the successful life. We need to know how we have come to believe that the best lives we can lead seem to involve sacrificing the best things about ourselves; and how we have come to believe that there are pleasures greater than kindness. Kindness, we will argue in this book&#x2014;not sexuality, not violence, not money&#x2014;has become our forbidden pleasure. What is it about our times that makes kindness seem so dangerous?</p><p>In one sense kindness is always hazardous because it is based on a susceptibility to others, a capacity to identify with their pleasures and sufferings. Putting oneself in someone else &#x2019;s shoes, as the saying goes, can be very uncomfortable. But if the pleasures of kindness&#x2014;like all the greatest human pleasures&#x2014;are inherently perilous, they are nonetheless some of the most satisfying we possess. How have we come to repudiate them? In 1741 the Scottish philosopher David Hume, confronted by a school of philosophy that held mankind to be irredeemably selfish, lost patience. Any person foolish enoughto deny the existence of human kindness had simply lost touch with emotional reality, Hume insisted: &#x201c;he has forgotten the movements of his heart.&#x201d; How do people come to forget about kindness and the deep pleasures it gives to them?</p><p>On Kindness seeks to answer this question. Written by a historian and a psychoanalyst, it reveals the cost and, froma historical point of view, the peculiarity of modern attitudes to kindness. For nearly all of human history&#x2014;up to and beyond David Hume &#x2019;s day, the so-called dawn of modernity&#x2014; people have perceived themselves as naturally kind. Thisbook shows when and why this confidence evaporated and the consequences of this transformation: how in giving up on kindness&#x2014;and especially our own acts of kindness&#x2014;we deprive ourselves of a pleasure that is fundamental to our sense of well-being. &#x201c;We mutually belong to one another,&#x201c; the philosopher Alan Ryan writes, and the good life is one &#x201c;that reflects this truth.&#x201d; Today this truth has gone underground. Independence and self-reliance are now the great aspirations; &#x201c;mutual belonging&#x201d; is feared and unspoken; it has become one of the great taboos of our society. Why?</p><p>To answer this we begin by looking back at ideas about kindness from the classical age onward. Kindness&#x2019;s original meaning of kinship or sameness has stretched over time to encompass sentiments that today go by a wide variety of names&#x2014;sympathy, generosity, altruism, benevolence, humanity, compassion, pity, empathy&#x2014;and that in the past were known by other terms as well, notably philanthropia (love of mankind) and caritas (neighborly or brotherly love). The precise meanings of these words vary, but fundamentally they all denote what the Victorians called &#x201c;open-heartedness,&#x201c; the sympathetic expansiveness linking self to other. &#x201c;No less indiscriminate and general than the alienation between people is the desire to breach it,&#x201c; the German critic Theodor Adorno once wrote, suggesting that even though our alienation, our distance from other people, may make us feel safe, it also makes us sorry, as though loneliness is the inevitable cost of looking after ourselves. History shows us the manifold expressions of humanity&#x2019;s desire to connect, from classical celebrations of friendship, to Christian teachings on love and charity, to twentieth-century philosophies of social welfare. It also shows us the degree of human alienation, how our capacity to care for each other is inhibited by fears and rivalrieswith a pedigree as long as kindness itself.</p><p>For most of Western history the dominant tradition of kindness has been Christianity, which sacralizes people &#x2019;s generous instincts and makes them the basis of a universalist faith. For centuries, Christian caritas functioned as a culturalcement, binding individuals into society. But from the sixteenth century, the Christian rule &#x201c;love thy neighbor as thyself &#x201c; came under increasing attack from competitive individualism. Thomas Hobbes&#x2019;s Leviathan (1651)&#x2014;the urtext of the new individualism&#x2014;dismissed Christian kindness as a psychological absurdity. Men, Hobbes insisted, were selfish beasts who cared for nothing but their own well-being; human existence was a &#x201c;warre of alle against alle.&#x201d; His arguments were slow to gain ground, but by the end of the eighteenth century&#x2014; despite the best efforts of David Hume and others&#x2014;they were becoming orthodoxy. Two centuries later it seems we are all Hobbesians, convinced that self-interest is our ruling principle. (The French psychoanalyst Lacan suggested that the Christian injunction &#x201c;love thy neighbor as thyself &#x201c; must be ironic, because people hate themselves.) Kindly behavior is looked upon with suspicion; public espousals of kindness are dismissed as moralistic and sentimental. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just human nature,&#x201c; we say of selfish behavior; what more can we expect? Kindness is seen either as a cover story or as a failure of nerve. Popular icons of kindness&#x2014;Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa&#x2014;are either worshipped as saints or gleefully unmasked as self-serving hypocrites. Prioritizing the needs of others may be praiseworthy, we think, but it is certainly not normal.</p><p>So is it time to give up on being kind? Or at least to drop kindness as one of the things we claim to value, and instead just enjoy the apparently spontaneous but fleeting moments of kindness in our lives while acknowledging that, for selfish creatures like ourselves, these moments are the exceptions that prove the rule?</p><p>Today it is only between parents and children that kindness is expected, sanctioned, and indeed obligatory. But before we condemn the mother who rages at her toddler in the street, we might stop to consider what it feels like to be a parent in a society where kindness is incidentally praised while being implicitly discouraged. Kindness&#x2014;that is, the ability to bear the vulnerability of others, and therefore of oneself&#x2014; has become a sign of weakness (except of course among saintly people, in whom it is a sign of their exceptionality). No one yet says parents should stop being kind to their children. Nonetheless we have become phobic of kindness in our societies, avoiding obvious acts of kindness and producing, as we dowith phobias, endless rationalizations to justify our avoidance. All compassion is self-pity, D. H. Lawrence remarked, and this usefully formulates the widespread modern suspicion of kindness: that it is either a higher form of selfishness (the kind that is morally triumphant and secretly exploitative) or the lowest form of weakness (kindness is the way the weak control the strong, the kind are only kind because they haven&#x2019;t got the guts to be anything else). If we think of humans as essentially competitive, and therefore triumphalist by inclination, as we are encouraged to do, then kindness looks distinctlyold-fashioned, indeed nostalgic, a vestige from a time when we could recognize ourselves in each other and feel sympatheticbecause of our kindness&#x2014;if such a time ever existed. And what, after all, can kindness help us win, except moral approval; or possibly not even that, in a society where &#x201c;respect&#x201d; for personal status has become a leading value.</p><p>Most people, as they grow up now, secretly believe that kindness is a virtue of losers.

He recounts in vivid detail his childhood and education in the Black Metropolis of Bronzeville and South Side neighborhoods that make up his "sacred ground."<br><br> Revealing a priceless trove of experiences, memories, ideas, and opinions, Black describes how it felt to belong to this place, even when stationed in Europe during World War II. He relates how African American soldiers experienced challenges and conflicts during the war, illuminating how these struggles foreshadowed the civil rights movement. A labor organizer, educator, and activist, Black captures fascinating anecdotes and vignettes of meeting with famous figures of the times, such as Duke Ellington and Martin Luther King Jr., but also with unheralded people whose lives convey lessons about striving, uplift, and personal integrity.<br><br> Rounding out this memoir, Black reflects on the legacy of his friend and mentee, Barack Obama, as well as on his public works and enduring relationships with students, community workers, and some very influential figures in Chicago and the world.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>TIMUEL D.

For years the verse that he had been composing since 1939 had been published under pseudonyms in his native Poland. After his election as Pope John Paul II in 1978, Wojtyla was identified as the poet and editions of his work were published around the world. <br> &nbsp;<br> This collection represents all of the poems written by the pope between 1939 and 1978, in a translation by Jerzy Peterkiewicz that is the only English one authorized by the Vatican.

After studying literature and drama in Cracow, he worked in a stone quarry and a chemical plant before he began studying for the priesthood in 1942. He was hidden from the German occupation forces by the Archbishop of Cracow and was ordained in 1946. In 1958 he was named bishop of Cracow, and became archbishop in 1964 and a cardinal in 1967. On October 16, 1978, Wojtyla was elected pope, the first non-Italian bishop of Rome in nearly five hundred years. He took the name John Paul II, in honor of his short-lived and much-loved predecessor, John Paul I. Karol Wojtyla died in 2005.

The only European city in which both the Allies and the Axis power operated openly, it was temporary home to much of Europe's exiled royalty, over one million refugees seeking passage to the U.S., and a host of spies, secret police, captains of industry, bankers, prominent Jews, writers and artists, escaped POWs, and black marketeers. An operations officer writing in 1944 described the daily scene at Lisbon's airport as being like the movie Casablanca,&#x201d; times twenty.<p> In this riveting narrative, renowned historian Neill Lochery draws on his relationships with high-level Portuguese contacts, access to records recently uncovered from Portuguese secret police and banking archives, and other unpublished documents to offer a revelatory portrait of the War's back stage. And he tells the story of how Portugal, a relatively poor European country trying frantically to remain neutral amidst extraordinary pressures, survived the war not only physically intact but significantly wealthier. The country's emergence as a prosperous European Union nation would be financed in part, it turns out, by a cache of Nazi gold.</p></p><p><b>Neill Lochery, PhD</b>, is a world-renowned source on Israel, the Middle East, and Mediterranean history.

In months Europe will be Hitler's. And Badenheim, a resort town vaguely in the orbit of Vienna, is preparing for its summer season. The vacationers arrive as they always have, a sampling of Jewish middle-class life: the impresario Dr. Pappenheim, his musicians, and their conductor; the gay Frau Tsauberblit; the historian, Dr. Fussholdt, and his much younger wife; the "readers," twins whose passion for Rilke is featured on their program; a child prodigy; a commercial traveler; a rabbi. The list waxes as the summer wanes. To receive them in the town are the pharmacist and his worried wife, the hotelier and his large staff, the pastry shop owner and his irritable baker, Sally and Gertie (two quite respectable prostitutes), and, mysteriously, the bland inspectors from the "Sanitation Department."<br><br>The story unfolds as matter-of-factly as a Chekhov play. The characters on stage are so deeply held by their defensive daily trivia that they manage to misconstrue every signal of their fate. Finally, the vacationers, whose numbers have now increased by the forced crowding-in of other Jews hardly on vacation, become de facto prisoners in their familiar resort; their "vacation" begins to take on the lineaments of undefined disaster. The text builds a sense of foreboding in which each human detail is so persuasive, so right in its fidelity to the terrible evasions of the time, that it leaves us transformed by what we and the author know must, and will, happen to Badenheim's visitors.<br><br>Badenheim 1939 owes everything to its author's astonishing capacity to recreate the energies and confusions of innocent and uncomprehending victims who, always loyal to civility and social graces, fail to even dimly see the cruel terms of their imminent fate.</p><p>This beautiful novel opens on the eve of World War II as a group of middle-class Jews arrive in the resort town of Badenheim, somewhere in Austria, ready to spend another idyllic summer vacation. But Europe in 1939 is no vacationland. Rumors of war rumble into the resort town, but the characters struggle to convince themselves that everything is perfectly normal. The great pleasure of the book comes in the Kafkaesque quality of Appelfeld&#39;s eye for the everyday and his restrained prose, set against the intimations of the approaching catastrophe.

His contemporaries said St. Albert simply knew all there was to know; he was a scientist, theologian, and philosopher; a teacher, preacher, and negotiator; a shrewd shepherd and an unflinching defender of the Faith. The time has come to re-discover St. Albert's greatness, and to profit from his prodigious wisdom and virtue as did his famous student, St. Thomas Aquinas.<br><br> Author Kevin Vost presents St. Albert's brilliant scholarly career at the height of the Church's intellectual renewal in the thirteenth century. St. Albert was tireless (and courageous) in his leadership and works of reform as a Dominican provincial and diocesan bishop. Desperate popes pressed him into diplomatic missions, hoping that Magnus might succeed in making peace where lesser men had failed.<br><br> These pages not only tell St. Albert's story they share his lessons. Each chapter uses Albertine teachings, and the witness of the saint's life, to instruct, edify, and inspire us to greater holiness and more ardent love.

Here, Robbins brings Stewart's story vividly to life.<br> Written off as a pompous showman past the prime of his career, Stewart emerged from a long slump in the unforgettable season of 1999 to capture the U.S. Open and play on the victorious U.S. Ryder Cup team. He appeared to be a new man that summer: wiser, deeper, and on the verge of a new level of greatness. Then his journey to redemption ended in October, when his chartered Learjet flew aimlessly for more than a thousand miles, ran out of fuel, and fell to earth in a prairie in South Dakota.<br><br> His death marked the end of an era, one made up of "shotmakers" who played the game with artistry, guile, finesse, and heart. Behind them were Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, and other young players whose power and strength changed the PGA Tour forever. With exclusive access to Stewart's friends, family, and onetime colleagues, Kevin Robbins provides a long-overdue portrait of one of golf's greats in one of golf's greatest seasons.</p><p><b>Kevin Robbins</b> is an award-winning veteran sports writer and the author of <i>Harvey Penick, </i>co-winner of the 2017 Herbert Warren Wind International Book Award.

Yet Kevin Robbins has pulled off the impossible: By charting Stewart's herky-jerk walk from brattishness to humility, while illuminating his play as the last-gasp of a golf now gone forever, he has revealed in his subject a largeness, a grace, that even Stewart never dreamed he had. So buy in -- and buckle up. Robbins' meticulously-reported work on Stewart's last hours stands as some of the finest writing on flight -- both its beauty and horrors -- published in years."&#x2015;<b><i>S.L.

Struggling to make friends and deal with his anger toward his absent father, Leigh loses himself in a class assignment in which he must write to his favorite author.

And he never imagines the kinds of things he'll be writing about: <blockquote> Dear Mr. Henshaw, I am sorry I was rude in my last letter... Maybe I was mad about other things, like Dad forgetting to send this month's support payment. Mom tried to phone him at the trailer park where, as Mom says, he hangs his hat. </blockquote> It's not easy being the new kid in town, with recently divorced parents, no dog anymore, and a lunch that gets stolen every day (all the "good stuff," anyway).

Rooted in the fundamentals of Taoism, it evolved into a system vastly different from Western astrology. Rather than determining personality by the time of the year in which you are born, in Taoist astrology it is the year itself that determines your character. The years form a twelve-year cycle of signs, each named after an animal. Additionally, your personality depends on which of the five traditional Taoist elements you are born under--water, wood, fire, earth, or metal. This makes for a cycle of sixty unique signs. <i>Taoist Astrology</i> includes information for each sign's personality, compatibility, child-parent relations, and rising and falling fortunes during the twelve-year cycle. Discussions of yin and yang, Confucianism and Buddhism, Taoist alchemy, and the connection between Taoist astrology and Western astrology give you all the background you need for understanding one of the oldest systems of divination known to humanity. <br> <br><i>Taoist Astrology</i> differs from other books on the subject by grounding its concepts in the ancient traditions from which it originated.</p><p>Susan Levitt is a professional astrologer and Tarot consultant.

Harwell Award<br><br>Tennessee History Book Award<br><br>Doughlas Southall Freeman Award</strong><br><br>A critical moment in the Civil War, the Battle of Shiloh has been the subject of many books. However, none has told the story of Shiloh as Timothy Smith does in this volume, the first comprehensive history of the two-day battle in April 1862&#x2014;a battle so fluid and confusing that its true nature has eluded a clear narrative telling until now.<br><br>Unfolding over April 6th and 7th, the Battle of Shiloh produced the most sprawling and bloody field of combat since the Napoleonic wars, with an outcome that set the Confederacy on the road to defeat. Contrary to previous histories, Smith tells us, the battle was not won or lost on the first day, but rather in the decision-making of the night that followed and in the next day's fighting. Devoting unprecedented attention to the details of that second day, his book shows how the Union's triumph was far less assured, and much harder to achieve, than has been acknowledged. Smith also employs a new organization strategy to clarify the action. By breaking his analysis of both days' fighting into separate phases and sectors, he makes it much easier to grasp what was happening in each combat zone, why it unfolded as it did, and how it related to the broader tactical and operational context of the entire battle.<br><br>The battlefield's diverse and challenging terrain also comes in for new scrutiny. Through detailed attention to the terrain's major features&#x2014;most still visible at the Shiloh National Military Park&#x2014;Smith is able to track their specific and considerable influence on the actions, and their consequences, over those forty-eight hours. The experience of the soldiers finally finds its place here too, as Smith lets us hear, as never before, the voices of the common man, whether combatant or local civilian, caught up in a historic battle for their lives, their land, their honor, and their homes.<br><br>"We must this day conquer or perish," Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston declared on the morning of April 6, 1862. His words proved prophetic, and might serve as an epitaph for the larger war, as we see fully for the first time in this unparalleled and surely definitive history of the Battle of Shiloh.</p><p>Timothy B. Smith served as a park ranger at Shiloh National Military Park for six years and now teaches history at the University of Tennessee at Martin. He is the author of eleven books about the Civil War, including <i>Corinth: Siege, Battle, Occupation</i> (also from Kansas), which won the Fletcher Pratt Award and McLemore Prize."With lucid prose, Smith has successfully bridged the frustratingly elusive gap between exhaustive scholarly research and good storytelling. . . . A well-narrated story of battle that has too often been overshadowed by the engagements that followed it. By placing it in context, Smith convincingly argues that Shiloh was one of the most critical contingency points of the war."--<i><b>Journal of Southern History</b></i><p>"Smith has provided an easily accessible narrative on how the Battle of Shiloh unfolded. His balanced treatment of both days of combat and his emphasis on how the terrain impacted the proceedings presents an authoritative text valuable for both historians and Civil War enthusiasts."--<i><b>Register of the Kentucky Historical Society</b></i></p><p>"Smith's study is unquestionably the new standard treatment of the Shiloh battle. It is very highly recommended reading."--<i><b>On Point: The Journal of Army History</b></i></p><p>"Only the dead know Shiloh better than Tim Smith."--<b><i>Civil War Times</i></b></p><p>"Smith's exhaustive and uniquely complete study is the first truly great treatment and is unquestionably the new standard bearer of Shiloh battle histories."--<b><i>Civil War Books and Authors</i></b><br><br>"One of the nation's leading Civil War historians, Tim Smith has produced what may be his best work yet. This volume is the definitive book on the critical battle of Shiloh. Its stirring prose and exhaustive research will stir the historical imagination of scholars and the general public both."--<b>John F. Marszalek</b>, Executive Director of the Ulysses S. Grant Association's Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library at Mississippi State University</p><p> "Well written, highly readable, and a great improvement over previous studies, this is easily the most comprehensive account yet written of the Battle of Shiloh, and it's hard to imagine it being superseded within the next several decades. Indeed, this may still be the definitive account when the battle's bicentennial rolls around."--<b>Steven E. Woodworth</b>, author of <i>Shiloh: Confederate High Tide in the Heartland</i></p></p><h2>The Didache: The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles: A Different Faith - A Different Salvation</h2><p>Containing the Didache in English and Greek, The &#34;Q&#34; (Source) Document, and the Book of James. What form did Christianity take in the first thirty years? Before the Jewish Christians were slaughtered by Rome and before the emergence of the Pauline sect, while the faith was still under the guiding hand of James, the brother of Jesus, what did the pure and unaltered church look like? By examining the Didache, the &#34;Q&#34; document, and the book of James we will look back into the first years of the faith. The difference between the beliefs of the apostles and modern Christianity will astonish you. The Didache is a manual written by the early Christians, a break away sect of Judaism, instructing converts on how to be Christians and how to conduct themselves in daily life. It is a magnificent view of the beliefs and rituals of the earliest form of Christianity as propagated by those who knew Jesus best; his brother and the original apostles. By the time of the Roman massacre of the Jews (66 C.E. - 70 C.E.) there were three major division in early Christianity: the original Jewish Christians, the gnostic Christians, and the quickly growing Pauline sect that was breaking away from its more formal Jewish roots. There was a one in three chance of the Pauline sect becoming the template of the Christianity of today. Had the war between the Romans and Jews not happened or had Paul failed to convert enough gentiles to his sect to outnumber those who followed James we could have a Messianic-Jewish based Christianity today. Our canon and our worship would be different, but because it would have been accepted, orthodox, and traditional, Christians would follow it as they follow the Pauline sect now. It is only by chance, or by the hand of god that the Didache is not the main document of catechism in the church today.</p><p>Joseph Lumpkin has a long and varied background in research and writing.

Tolton by a culture rooted in racial hatred, he became a tireless messenger of the Gospel, plunging into the Deep South where segregation was decreed by harsh laws, penetrating even the hardest of hearts with the richness, beauty, and truth of the Catholic Faith.</p> <p>He was a beacon of hope to black Catholics in the 19th Century who were trying to find a home in the American Church. He was a visionary who saw beyond race and politics, teaching that the Catholic Church wants to free us not just from slavery, but from slavery to sin.</p> <p>Amidst great persecution, Fr. Tolton showed us that being configured to Christ means emptying ourselves so that God can fill us, exposing the weakest parts of who we are so that God can make us strong, becoming blind to the ways of this world so Christ can lead us, and dying to ourselves so we can rise with Christ.</p> <p>All who seek to be formed more perfectly to Christ have a role model in Fr.

After dinner, he runs seamlessly through the evening routine of a chore, finishing homework, packing his backpack, and enjoying some free time, finally making the transition to bedtime relaxing and calm.<br> <br>If you are supporting a rigid, anxious, or distracted child, this scenario might seem like a fairy tale. I&#x2019;m here to tell you, as a professional organizer and as the parent of a sensory child, that this can be your reality. It&#x2019;s all about learning how to tap into simple systems, routines, and visual guides to support and organize your sensory child: tools that can empower both your child and your entire family.<br> <br>The numbers are staggering: thousands of young children are being diagnosed each year with anxiety disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD), autism spectrum disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger&#x2019;s disorder, pervasive developmental disorder&#x2013;not otherwise specified or PDD-NOS), pediatric bipolar or mood disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or sensory processing disorder (a behavior profile commonly seen with kids who have these diagnoses). There is also increasing evidence that some environmental factors like Lyme disease and PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with strep) can trigger or exacerbate some of these neurological and behavioral challenges.<br> <br>The treatment options for kids who present with these types of sensory issues are vast. Much success can come from a combination of supports such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy, accommodations/supports at school, and medication. However, there is so much that you as a parent can do, as well. That&#x2019;s where this book comes in. As a parent, how do you learn how to support your &#x201c;sensory&#x201d; child in the home and make your day-to-day living experience less stressful and more meaningful?<br> <br>&#x201c;Sensory&#x201d; kids&#x2014;including those with AD/HD, anxiety disorder, OCD, sensory processing disorder, bipolar disorder, and autism&#x2014;often look at the world through a different lens. There are so many questions parents have when learning to live with and support these sensory kids.<br> <br>�&nbsp;How can you develop simple ways to communicate and connect with your child?<br> <br>�&nbsp;How can you learn to anticipate and deal with the seemingly simple activities that create a major challenge for your child?<br> <br>�&nbsp;How can you create spaces in your home to help your sensory child feel comfortable and at ease?<br> <br>These are the kinds of practical, everyday issues that your doctors or therapists might not address. That&#x2019;s why I wrote The Sensory Child Gets Organized: to help bridge the gap between essential clinical support and practical in-home solutions.<br> <br>Through my experience as the parent of a sensory child and as a professional organizer, I know that sensory kids need special organizing solutions. Parents want to connect with their children, want to learn their &#x201c;language,&#x201d; and have peace at home. These Sensory Organizing techniques will show you how to use simple organization, structure, and visual aids in your everyday life to address some of your child&#x2019;s challenging sensory behaviors. This book offers practical, easy-to-implement strategies that can be life changing for you, your sensory child, and your entire family. Our sensory kids are smart, perceptive, connected, and loving when they feel understood and supported, and this is our goal!<br> My Journey to Systems for Sensory Kids<p></p> <br>My journey into the world of sensory kids and Sensory Organizing began in 2002, as my husband and I were learning how to live with and support our own sensory child. For our son, who was born healthy and happy, things seemed to take a sudden turn between eighteen months and two years of age. He started to show signs of some developmental delays, such as regression in speech and a new hyperfocus on certain activities and repetitive play. He also had explosive episodes, became overwhelmed with playgroups, and seemed to be much more internally focused. We then began the sometimes-frustrating process of evaluations, reports, and appointments trying to get a diagnosis. We were looking for answers. What is happening to our child?<br> <br>At age two, our son began getting speech and occupational therapy support through Early Intervention. It was extremely helpful for some very specific tasks that were challenging for our son and gave him some critical sensory input that he needed. I remember being so overwhelmed with all the other difficulties during our day: getting him to take a bath, cutting his nails, preparing him for a change in schedule, getting him to sit through dinner, and taking him to a birthday party, just to name a few. Many seemingly simple tasks were anything but simple. I was continually bombarding our speech and occupational therapists for information about how to support the way he was seeing the world, and how to make the days run more smoothly for him and for our new daughter, who arrived when he was two years old.<br> <br>Our son was like many children whose presentation comes down to &#x201c;a little bit of everything.&#x201d; Because his symptoms present as a combination of many diagnoses, I developed a real appreciation for what families were living with when supporting sensory processing disorder, AD/HD, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, Asperger&#x2019;s disorder, mood disorders, as well as strep-triggered tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder (PANDAS), and neurological symptoms (including attention problems, short-term memory loss, depression, mood swings, and/or learning disabilities) as a result of late-stage Lyme disease. I also began to develop a few key concepts to help my son deal with some of the challenges he faced, such as getting ready for school in the morning or doing homework in the evening.<br> <br>Over time, I began to see the power of structure and routine for my son in helping him navigate his day. He was a visual learner (like many sensory kids) and we began to tap into visual supports to help him with simple tasks inside the home. When we gave him labeled clothes storage bins, he was able to put clothes away and pick out clothes for school independently and without frustration. This became life changing for us. We made a conscious effort to concentrate on what was hard for him, and then develop a system or strategy to support him in overcoming the challenge. By picking a few challenging behaviors at a time and coming up with simple visual supports and routines, we could help him slowly modify his behavior.<br> <br>I also noticed how helpful it was to have his environment set up in a way that made sense to him. When he had a defined homework space, a visual homework plan with built-in breaks, and graphic organizers for difficult homework, he could be successful. The internal confusion could be countered externally with spaces that were clearly defined, had systems in place, and had visual supports incorporated. The impact of these simple changes was incredible. He slowly began to learn what systems worked well for him and when he needed a plan in place.<br> <br>The power of structure and routine provided an additional benefit that I had not planned on&#x2014;it also supported me! The sensory parenting experience for many involves a journey from denial to acceptance that can be a stressful and overwhelming experience, even for the most well-adjusted, typical adults out there. This stress is magnified tremendously if the parent has their own challenges around anxiety, emotional regulation, or distractibility and needs to learn how to help their child manage similar challenges. Sensory Organizing gives us parents the added gift of structure, routines, and visual aids that can support the process of managing life, our executive functioning challenges, and our overwhelmed days. When we support ourselves with simple organization, structure, and routines, we are infinitely better at supporting our sensory kids. Sensory Organizing can truly become a gift for the entire family.<br> <br>When I started my professional organizing business a few years ago, I knew there would be a piece of this kind of &#x201c;sensory organizing&#x201d; involved. Because the need is so great, that &#x201c;piece&#x201d; turned into a separate business, and Systems for Sensory Kids (SSK) was born. Recognizing how many overlapping behaviors there are in many different pediatric neurological and behavioral disorders, I wanted to focus on those challenging behaviors that families were living with daily. There is no doubt that these kids are extremely bright and can be very successful in almost anything they do as long as they have a plan in place that supports their way of processing information and sets them up to do well. Success breeds confidence.<br> <br>The main goal of The Sensory Child Gets Organized is to empower you and your family with a few simple, effective techniques that will help you and your child be happier, calmer, and more successful. I am not a doctor or clinician, and I never make a diagnosis. But from my own experience, extensive research, and working with so many other families, I know there is an enormous need for parent-based, practical solutions for the everyday challenges of raising a rigid, anxious, or distracted child. This book gives you a game plan for learning how to live with and best support your sensory kids at home which, in turn, will give them increased self-awareness and confidence. I also believe strongly in the power of a team, and part of the team in supporting most sensory kids is going to be that essential clinical support from psychologists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, pediatricians, neuropsychologists, and the many other professionals who work to support sensory kids. Early, consistent clinical support is so important in helping our kids reach their potential.<br> <br>The most important team, and the team that will have the biggest impact, is the team at home. Our whole family thrived with these supports, and it has helped us all have a better idea of who we are, what works for us individually, and how we can best support each other.<br> Let&#x2019;s Empower You to Learn Your Child&#x2019;s Language<p></p> <br>I know firsthand the power of learning your child&#x2019;s language and translating that knowledge into tangible supports for everyday life. We know that our sensory kids are bright, creative, and long to be successful in their daily tasks. I will teach you simple ways to learn your sensory child&#x2019;s language, as well as universal approaches to creating visual aids that will support current challenges.<br> <br>By the end of this book, my goal is to have you seamlessly observing, prioritizing needs, and creating supports for all types of different experiences. Having the correct sensory supports at home, and available for out-of-home experiences, will have a dramatic impact. These tools will also help our sensory kids feel capable, successful, and well on their way to a clear self-awareness of their own strengths.<br> <br>So let&#x2019;s start learning a new language, educating your team at home, and Sensory Organizing!</p><h2>Indian Bead-Weaving Patterns: Chain-Weaving Designs Bead Loom Weaving and Bead Embroidery - An Illustrated &#34;How-To&#34; Guide</h2><p>Written for both beginners and advanced beaders with over 200 illustrations and photographs of 47 bead-work pieces.

Braddock, Max Baer, and the Greatest Upset in Boxing History</h2><p>A riveting tale of perseverance in the face of hardship, Cinderella Man is the chronicle of the boxer James J. Braddock, whose exceptional story of achievement against all odds was the subject of a major motion picture. Braddock, dubbed the Cinderella Man, staged the greatest comeback in fighting history, rising in the span of twelve months from the relief rolls to a face-off against the heavyweight champion, Max Baer. <br><br>Against the gritty backdrop of Depression-era New York, Schaap paints a vivid picture of the fight world in its golden age, evoking a time when boxing resonated with a country trying desperately to get back on its feet.</p><p>Includes a one-hour interview from 1970 with boxing legend James Braddock! <br>Lost in the annals of boxing is the sport's true Cinderella story. James J. Braddock, dubbed "Cinderella Man" by Damon Runyon, was a once promising light heavyweight for whom a string of losses in the ring and a broken right hand happened to correspond with the Great Crash. With one good hand, Braddock was forced to labor on the docks of Hoboken. Only his manager, Joe Gould, still believed in him, finding fights for Braddock to help feed his wife and children. The diminutive, loquacious Jew and the burly, quiet Irishman made one of boxing's oddest couples, but together they staged the greatest comeback in boxing history. In less than twelve months Braddock went from the relief rolls to face heavyweight champion Max Baer, the Livermore Butcher Boy, renowned for having allegedly killed two men in the ring. A charismatic, natural talent and in every way Braddock's foil, Baer was a towering opponent, a Jew from the West Coast who was famously brash and made great copy both in and out of the ring. A ten-to-one underdog, Braddock carried the hopes and dreams of the working class on his shoulders. And when boxing was the biggest sport in the world, when the heavyweight champion was the biggest star in the world, his unlikely upset made him the most popular champion boxing had ever seen. <br>Against the gritty backdrop of the Depression, Cinderella Man brings this dramatic all-American story to life, evoking a time when the sport of boxing resonated with a country trying desperately to get back on its feet. Rich in anecdote and color, steeped in history, and full of human interest, Cinderella Man is a classic Davidand Goliath tale that transcends the sport. <p>"From the Compact Disc edition.</p><p>Jeremy Schaap is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Cinderella Man</i>.

P.L., Syracuse, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Emperor of Ocean Park</h2><p>In his triumphant fictional debut, Stephen Carter combines a large-scale, riveting novel of suspense with the saga of a unique family.<i> </i><b>The Emperor of Ocean Park</b> is set in two privileged worlds: the upper crust African American society of the Eastern seabord&#x2014;families who summer at Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard&#x2014;and the inner circle of an Ivy League law school. <br><br>Talcott Garland is a successful law professor, devoted father, and husband of a beautiful and ambitious woman, whose future desires may threaten the family he holds so dear. When Talcott&#x2019;s father, Judge Oliver Garland, a disgraced former Supreme Court nominee, is found dead under suspicioius circumstances, Talcott wonders if he may have been murdered. Guided by the elements of a mysterious puzzle that his father left, Talcott must risk his marriage, his career and even his life in his quest for justice. Superbly written and filled with memorable characters, <b>The Emperor of Ocean Park</b> is both a stunning literary achievement and a grand literary entertainment.</p><p>A complex, smart mystery filled with intrigue, drama, and more than a little danger awaits in Stephen L. Carter's engaging debut novel, <i>The Emperor of Ocean Park</i>. After the funeral of his powerful father (a federal judge whose nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court became a public scandal), Talcott Garland, an African American law professor at an Ivy League university, is left to unravel the meaning of a cryptic note and carry out "the arrangements" his father left behind. Armed with fortitude and familial devotion--though paranoid of his wife's fidelity--Talcott soon finds himself in an investigation that entangles him with a number of questionable Washington, D.C., denizens, including attorneys and government officials, law professors, the FBI, shady underworld figures, chess masters, and friends and family. All the while Talcott tries not to hurt his attorney wife's chance for a judicial nomination--and their fragile marriage--but the closer he comes to unraveling his father's dark secrets, the more dangerous things become. <p> Clocking in at over 650 pages, the novel could easily have been streamlined; many of Talcott's thoughts are unnecessarily repeated. But Carter's storytelling skills are adept: tension builds, surprises are genuine, clues are not handed out freely. The prose, while somewhat meandering, can be crisp and insightful, as demonstrated in Carter's description of the misguided paths of young attorneys who sacrifice </p><blockquote>all on the altar of career... at last arriving... at their cherished career goals, partnerships, professorships, judgeships, whatever kind of ships they dream of sailing, and then looking around at the angry, empty waters and realizing that they have arrived with nothing, absolutely nothing, and wondering what to do with the rest of their wretched lives.</blockquote> <i>--Michael Ferch</i>&#x201c;Rich, rewarding and compelling. . . .

His animated films of the era, including Princess Mononoke, Howl&#x2019;s Moving Castle, and Ponyo, were internationally lauded, and Miyazaki won an Academy Award� in 2003 for his popular and critical hit Spirited Away.<br><br> Follow Miyazaki as his vision matures, as cinema-lovers worldwide embrace his creations, and as critics such as Roger Ebert take up the cause of animation and Miyazaki&#x2019;s films. In a legendary career, these crucial years represent the turning point.</p><p>Hayao Miyazaki is one of Japan&#39;s most beloved animation directors. In 2005 he was awarded the Venice International Film Festival&#39;s Golden Lion Award for Lifetime Achievement, and his Studio Ghibli received the festival&#39;s Osella Award for overall achievement in 2004. Miyazaki&#39;s films include Spirited Away, winner of the 2002 Academy Award� for Best Animated Feature Film, as well as Castle in the Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, and Ponyo, all of which have received great acclaim in the U.S. Miyazaki&#39;s other achievements include the highly regarded manga series Nausica� of the Valley of the Wind and Starting Point: 1979-1996, a collection of essays, interviews, and memoirs that chronicle his early career and the development of his theories of animation.

To his beautiful secretary-mistress, he was a god-like hero to be served with her mind, soul and body. To his aristocratic young wife, he was an elemental force of nature to be tamed. To his millionaire father-in-law, he was a giant whose single error could be used to destroy him.<br><p>What kind of man was Bjorn Faulkner? Only you, the reader, can decide.<br></p><p>On one level, <b>Night of January 16th</b> is a totally gripping drama about the rise and destruction of a brilliant and ruthless man. On a deeper level, it is a superb dramatic objectification of <b>Ayn Rand</b>'s vision of human strength and weakness. Since its original Broadway success, it has achieved vast worldwide popularity and acclaim. </p><p></p></p><p>McKay&#39;s Play Series comprises a group of three-act and one-act plays which have been selected because of their appropriateness for amateurs. Many of them have had prosperous and nationally advertised New York success. They are the plays your audience want to see and enjoy.Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.</p><h2>The Slave</h2><p><p>Four years after the Chmielnicki massacres of the seventeenth century, Jacob, a slave and cowherd in a Polish village high in the mountains, falls in love with Wanda, his master's daughter. Even after he is ransomed, he finds he can't live without her, and the two escape together to a distant Jewish community. Racked by his consciousness of sin in taking a Gentile wife and by the difficulties of concealing her identity, Jacob nonetheless stands firm as the violence of the era threatens to destroy the ill-fated couple.</p></p><p><p><b>Isaac Bashevis Singer</b> (1904-91) was the author of many novels, stories, children's book, and memoirs. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.</p>Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote with passion about Jews and their struggles in Europe. In THE SLAVE, Singer tells the story of Jacob, enslaved following a 1648 Polish uprising, and Wanda, a Christian with whom he falls in love. After being freed, Jacob returns to marry Wanda, and they face a life of complications created by their "unthinkable" union. The use of two readers is ideal. David Chandler and Tracy Sallows are flawless as they infuse the characters with intensity and conviction that seem to derive directly from Singer. Chandler provides Jacob with the ideal mix of indignation and righteousness, whether he endures scorn, accepts reverence for his knowledge, or suffers from tragedy. THE SLAVE demonstrates why Singer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. D.J.S.

The answer to that question will determine how it is taught. Yet despite the enduring belief in this country that science <i>should</i> be taught, there has been no enduring consensus about how or why.</p><p>This is especially true when it comes to teaching scientific process. Nearly all of the basic knowledge we have about the world is rock solid. The science we teach in high schools in particular&#x2015;laws of motion, the structure of the atom, cell division, DNA replication, the universal speed limit of light&#x2015;is accepted as the way nature works. Everyone also agrees that students and the public more generally should understand the methods used to gain this knowledge. But what exactly is the scientific method?</p><p>Ever since the late 1800s, scientists and science educators have grappled with that question. Through the years, they&#x2019;ve advanced an assortment of strategies, ranging from &#x201c;the laboratory method&#x201d; to the &#x201c;five-step method&#x201d; to &#x201c;science as inquiry&#x201d; to no method at all. <i>How We Teach Science</i> reveals that each strategy was influenced by the intellectual, cultural, and political circumstances of the time. In some eras, learning about experimentation and scientific inquiry was seen to contribute to an individual&#x2019;s intellectual and moral improvement, while in others it was viewed as a way to minimize public interference in institutional science.</p><p>John Rudolph shows that how we think about and teach science will either sustain or thwart future innovation, and ultimately determine how science is perceived and received by the public.</p></p><p>John L. Rudolph is a Professor at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison, where he teaches in the departments of Curriculum &amp; Instruction and Educational Policy Studies and is a faculty affiliate of the Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies. His research focuses on the practice and history of science education in American high schools. Rudolph was Editor-in-Chief of<i> Science Education</i> from 2011 to 2016 and spent a number of years teaching physics, chemistry, and biology in middle schools and high schools across Wisconsin.&#x201c;Scientific research has changed a great deal over the past century, but the ways that students have learned about science have changed even more dramatically. In this engaging and wide-ranging study, historian John Rudolph traces enormous pedagogical shifts, the aspirations behind them, and why they matter for scientists and citizens today.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Kaiser, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b><br><br>&#x201c;Rudolph is...laser focused on the &#x2018;how&#x2019; of the science classroom&#x2015;how its practice varies across time, how its meaning is debated by reformers, and how its role in education shifts as schools themselves change. And for that discussion there is no better guide.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher J. Phillips</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Rudolph&#x2019;s excellent description of early science instruction is especially relevant today because we have not advanced much in this regard. We are frankly miserable at teaching science to students, even in the face of the most momentous technological achievements in human history...We must, as Rudolph encourages us, modify our errors in science education, emphasizing its absolute relevance to our existence.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jennifer Schnellmann</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Higher Education</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Why should we teach science? And how should we teach it? John Rudolph provides our first thorough history of the many ways that American educators have imagined&#x2015;and instructed&#x2015;science over the past century. At a moment when &#x2018;STEM&#x2019; fields have become almost a fetish in American culture and education, I hope we can pause long enough to ask ourselves why. Nobody will be able to frame a good answer without first consulting this masterful book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Zimmerman, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>How We Teach Science</i> is a provocative interrogation into the teaching of the scientific method. Weaving a tapestry of influences on policy and practice, John Rudolph delivers an insightful historical examination of the oscillating institutional goals for science education, highlighting social tensions surrounding teaching the natural sciences during the twentieth century.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Duschl, Southern Methodist University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Offers insight into science education&#x2019;s gradual transition from the laboratory method of the late 19th century to the current Next Generation Science Standards...Importantly, Rudolph also examines how these methods have variously failed to contribute to scientific literacy and how educators and reformers might move forward in the future.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Choice</i></b></p><h2>Reflecting Children&#39;s Lives: A Handbook for Planning Your Child-Centered Curriculum</h2><p>Make the complex task of creating a child-centered curriculum easier with the practical guidelines and ideas in this updated and expanded handbook.

Stevens is a tenured professor in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at Portland State University in Oregon where she has been since 1994. Her roots, however, are in the public school classroom where she taught middle school and high school social studies, language arts, and special education for 14 years across four school districts and three states. She received her master's from the University of Utah in 1983, and a doctorate in educational psychology from Michigan State in 1991. Before coming to PSU she taught at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington. Whether the topic is rubrics, journal writing, action research or academic writing, her work centers on how adults reflect on what they do and, then, act on those reflections. One of Dr. Stevens' underlying assumptions is that cognitive, social and emotional development does not end with the teenage years but continues through the lifetime. Besides over 75 conference presentations, she has written three books, all designed to impact development of her fellow faculty and their students. Her first book, co-edited with Joanne Cooper, <i>Tenure in the Sacred Grove: Issues and Strategies for Women and Minorities</i>, (SUNY Press, 2002), was written to help faculty women and minorities negotiate the path to tenure. <i>Introduction to Rubrics</i>, now in its second edition, and co-authored with Antonia J. Levi, and <i>Journal Keeping</i>, co-authored with Joanne Cooper, are both published by Stylus Publishing. In addition to teaching classes, she has taken on leadership positions in the department and campus-wide. In the Curriculum and Instruction Department, Dr. Stevens leads teacher licensure cohorts and coordinates the MA/MS program for experienced teachers. For the university at large, she works within the Center for Academic Excellence as faculty-in-residence for assessment. She is chair of the Institutional Assessment Council.<br><br>Joanne E.

Organizing library collections may seem like a straightforward and streamlined process, but it can be quite complex, and there is a large body of theory and practice that shape and support this work. Learning about the organization of library collections can be challenging. Libraries have a long history of organizing their collections, there are many principles, models, standards, and tools used to organize collections, and theory and practice are changing constantly. <br>Written for beginning library science students, Organizing Library Collections: Theory and Practice introduces the theory and practice of organizing library collections in a clear, straightforward, and understandable way. It explains why and how libraries organize their collections, and how theory and practice work together to help library users. It introduces basic cataloging and metadata theory, describes and evaluates the major cataloging and metadata standards and tools used to organize library collections, and explains, in general, how all libraries organize their collections in practice. Yet, this book not only introduces theory and practice in general, it introduces students to a wide range of topics involved in organizing library collections. This book explores how academic, public, school, and special libraries typically organize their collections and why. It also discusses standardization and explains how cataloging and metadata standards and policies are developed. Ethical issues also are explored and ethical decision-making is addressed. In addition, several discussion questions and class activities reinforce concepts introduced in each chapter. Students should walk away from this book understanding why and how libraries organize their collections.</p><p>Gretchen Hoffman is an Associate Professor in the School of Library and Information Studies at Texas Woman&#x2019;s University. She has been teaching there since 2007. Her teaching and research agenda centers on the organization of information, specifically library cataloging. Courses she teaches include Cataloging and Classification, Advanced Cataloging and Classification, Collection Development, and Information Organization. <br><br>Before moving to Texas Woman&#x2019;s University, Hoffman was a professional cataloger at the University of Kansas, specializing in complex and difficult cataloging, music cataloging (scores and audio recordings), and cataloging German-language monographs. Prior to that, she worked as a professional serials cataloger at Portland State University, specializing in federal government documents.Dr. Hoffman has written a much-needed primer for understanding the basics and importance of cataloging in libraries. Students new to librarianship and practitioners looking to refresh their cataloging knowledge would benefit from reading Dr. Hoffman's straightforward, richly illustrated narrative. The end-of-chapter discussion questions and class activity suggestions make this the perfect text for information organization courses and interactive study for practitioners. (Karen Snow, associate professor, School of Information Studies, Dominican University)<br><br>As a teacher of both organization of information and cataloging in a library school program, I can confirm what she acknowledges: that this is a topic that students come to in library school with little or no knowledge of and the overwhelming number of acronyms used in this branch of LIS. So I am happy to see that the book is very straightforward in its language; it assumes no prior knowledge and explains concepts in layman's terms. (Sarah W. Sutton, Ph.D., associate professor, School of Library &amp; Information Management, Emporia State University)<br><br>Replete with theoretical and practical knowledge for both the beginning and the professional cataloger, this book covers methods, issues, and challenges faced today in organizing library collections.

What is it in American culture that makes conspiracy theories proliferate? Who is targeted, and why? Are we in the heyday of the conspiracy theory, or is it in decline? <br><br>Though there is significant scholarly literature on the topic in psychology, sociology, philosophy, and more, <em>American Conspiracy Theories</em> is the first to use broad, long-term empirical data to analyze this popular American tendency. Joseph E. Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent draw on three sources of original data: 120,000 letters to the editor of the New York Times and Chicago Tribune from between 1890 and 2010; a two-wave survey from before and after the 2012 presidential election; and discussions of conspiracy theories culled from online news sources, blogs, and other Web sites, also from before and after the election. Through these sources, they are able to address crucial questions, such as similarities and differences in the nature of conspiracy theories over time, the role of the Internet and communications technologies in spreading modern conspiracy theories, and whether politics, economics, media, war, or other factors are most important in popularizing conspiratorial beliefs. Ultimately, they conclude that power asymmetries, both foreign and domestic, are the main drivers behind conspiracy theories, and that those at the bottom of power hierarchies have a strategic interest in blaming those at the top-in other words, "conspiracy theories are for losers." But these "losers" can end up having tremendous influence on the course of history, and<em> American Conspiracy Theories</em> is an unprecedented examination of one of the defining features of American political life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Joseph E. Uscinski</strong> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at University of Miami. <br><br><strong>Joseph M. Parent</strong> is Assistant Professor of Political Science at University of Notre Dame.<br><br>"There are plenty of myths and misapprehensions about conspiracy theories and the damage they do. In this path-breaking book, Parent and Uscinski sift fact from fiction to set the record straight about who believes in conspiracy theories, when, why, and with what political consequences. Their answers will surprise you." --David Runciman, University of Cambridge <br><p></p><br>"This fascinating book tackles some of the thorniest questions about conspiracy theories: who believes them, why do they believe them, and how have these beliefs changed over time? The authors' extensive research shows that Americans are actually less prone to conspiratorial thinking than they were just a few decades ago. Their findings are surprising and sure to provoke debate on this timely and important topic." --Kathy Olmsted, University of California, Davis <br><p></p><br>"Uscinski and Parent provide the most comprehensive social scientific explanation to date for why conspiratorial beliefs are so prevalent in the United States. Drawing on an eclectic array of original data sources, which remarkably include more than 100,000 letters to the editors of two major newspapers from 1890 to 2010, the authors convincingly identify the features uniting over a century of conspiratorial beliefs. This books is therefore a must read for anyone interested in political misinformation in general, and American conspiracy theories in particular." --Michael Tesler, University of California, Irvine <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Ethical Conflicts in Psychology</h2><p>First published in 1995, <i>Ethical Conflicts in Psychology</i> has long been a definitive resource for students, researchers, and practitioners.&nbsp; Widely adopted as a textbook in graduate psychology courses in ethics and continuing education development, this innovative volume presents readers with over 100 different perspectives on crucial and tricky ethical issues, including the duty to protect, multiple relationships, privacy, privileged communication, navigating federal regulations governing the transmission of health care records under HIPAA, testifying as an expert witness, and practicing ethically within the boundaries of managed care.

Now, drawing on rarely consulted archives, Frederick Crews has assembled a great volume of evidence that reveals a surprising new Freud: a man who blundered tragicomically in his dealings with patients, who in fact never cured anyone, who promoted cocaine as a miracle drug capable of curing a wide range of diseases, and who advanced his career through falsifying case histories and betraying the mentors who had helped him to rise. The legend has persisted, Crews shows, thanks to Freud&#x2019;s fictive self-invention as a master detective of the psyche, and later through a campaign of censorship and falsification conducted by his followers.</p><p>A monumental biographical study and a slashing critique, <i>Freud: The Making of an Illusion</i> will stand as the last word on one of the most significant and contested figures of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Frederick Crews</b> is the author of many books, including the bestselling satire <i>The Pooh Perplex</i> and <i>Follies of the Wise</i>, which was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award.

Are Jews descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Today, DNA science reveals that almost all the Jews in the world come from Khazaria. They are not of the blood lineage of Abraham and the prophets, but of King Bulan and the pagan peoples of the Caucasus. The ancestors of today&#39;s Jews are not Israelites but are Khazarians. Khazaria&#39;s people, in the 8th century, converted from paganism to Judaism. In the 10th century, these Khazarian &#34;Jewish&#34; converts emigrated to Eastern Europe, and especially Poland and Lithuania. In 1948, the Khazars, erroneously believing themselves to be &#34;Jews,&#34; arrived in the territory of Palestine and set up the state of Israel. The people of Israel today are virtually all of Khazar (Turk/Mongol stock) extraction. The &#34;Jews&#34; have no genetic claims to the land of Israel and no family connection whatsoever to historical Israel. DNA science joins recent discoveries in history and archaeology to present the world with a correct and remarkable picture of the Jewish people.

How should we be good? And how might we more deeply understand the moral and ethical failings--splashed across today's headlines--that have not only destroyed individual lives but caused widespread calamity as well, bringing communities, nations, and indeed the global economy to the brink of collapse? <br>In <em>The Difficulty of Being Good</em>, Gurcharan Das seeks answers to these questions in an unlikely source: the 2,000 year-old Sanskrit epic, <em>Mahabharata</em>. A sprawling, witty, ironic, and delightful poem, the <em>Mahabharata</em> is obsessed with the elusive notion of dharma--in essence, doing the right thing. When a hero does something wrong in a Greek epic, he wastes little time on self-reflection; when a hero falters in the <em>Mahabharata</em>, the action stops and everyone weighs in with a different and often contradictory take on dharma. Each major character in the epic embodies a significant moral failing or virtue, and their struggles mirror with uncanny precision our own familiar emotions of anxiety, courage, despair, remorse, envy, compassion, vengefulness, and duty. Das explores the <em>Mahabharata</em> from many perspectives and compares the successes and failures of the poem's characters to those of contemporary individuals, many of them highly visible players in the world of economics, business, and politics. In every case, he finds striking parallels that carry lessons for everyone faced with ethical and moral dilemmas in today's complex world.<br>Written with the flair and seemingly effortless erudition that have made Gurcharan Das a bestselling author around the world--and enlivened by Das's forthright discussion of his own personal search for a more meaningful life--<em>The Difficulty of Being Good</em> shines the light of an ancient poem on the most challenging moral ambiguities of modern life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gurcharan Das</strong> is the author of the much-acclaimed <em>India Unbound</em>, which has been translated into many languages and filmed by the BBC. He writes a regular column for six Indian newspapers, including the <em>Times of India</em>, and occasionally for <em>Newsweek</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>Foreign Affairs</em>. His other books include the novel <em>A Fine Family</em>; a book of essays, <em>The Elephant Paradigm</em>; and an anthology, <em>Three English Plays</em>, consisting of <em>Larins Sahib, 9 Jakhoo Hill</em>, and <em>Mira</em>.<br><br>''The book is a wonderful combination of the scholarly and the personal, the academic and the meditative. The basic plan works beautifully, building a rich mix of his very, very careful and detailed reading of the text, his other wide reading, and his life in business; an extraordinary blend. I found the use of evolutionary biology and the Prisoner's Dilemma to explain the pragmatism of the Mahabharata absolutely brilliant.'' <br>--Wendy Doniger, Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions, University of Chicago <br><p></p><br>''The book is a remarkable tour de force that connects an ageless philosophical epic to the travails of contemporary society. This book is for the liberal Hindu who does not want his religion co-opted, for the modern Indian who wants to build a fair and inclusive society and for the global citizen who is rendered asunder by moral absolutism. The dharmic challenges we face every day resonate throughout Gurcharan's book. Reading this book has been an enriching experience!'' <br> --Nandan Nilekani, author of Imagining India <br><p></p><br>''Through a series of bravura readings of the Mahabharata, Gurcharan Das makes a learned and passionate attempt to inform how the great Indian epic might illuminate our present-day moral dilemmas. Readers will find his analyses of dharma insightful, challenging, and honest--doing full justice to the world's most complex, exciting and honest poem. <br> <br> This admirable book offers precisely the kind of reflection that the epic itself invites--moral, political and public. It shows why the Mahabharata is a classic: because it is ever timely. This superb book is knowledgeable, passionate, and even courageous. Grounded in a secure knowledge of the narrative, it raises key moral problems--from the doctrine of just war to affirmative action to the nature of suffering--and it makes striking attempts to link these with contemporary discussions and issues, both public and personal.'' <br>--Sheldon Pollock, William B. Ransford Professor of Sanskrit and Indian Studies, Columbia University<p></p><br>''The book is a kind of miracle: a deeply sensitive man suddenly decides to leave his usual routines and familiar roles and to spend some years simply reading the Mahabharata and seeing what the ancient epic has to tell him; he engages profoundly with the text, with the bewildering profusion of its messages, its tormented heroes, and the dramatic events it describes; and he then finds the space and the right words for a thoughtful, highly personal, philosophically informed, skeptical, sustained response. Such things happen only rarely in our generation, and we should all be grateful to Gurcharan Das for this gift.'' <br>--David Shulman, Renee Lang Professor of Humanistic Studies, Hebrew University<p></p><br>''This book is a triple treat. It provides a subtle reading of episodes in the Mahabharata. It uses those readings to raise consistently provocative questions about the character of dharma. And it addresses important questions about the character of our ethical lives....It wears its learning lightly, prompting one to think, and hence it is a pleasure and a provocation.'' <br>--Pratap Bhanu Mehta, political scientist and president, Centre for Policy Research, New Delhi <br> <br><p></p><br>''This wise, passionate, and illuminating book is one of the best things I've read about the contribution of great literature to ethical thought.'' <br>--Martha Nussbaum, Professor of Philosophy, University of Chicago<p></p><br>''Gurcharan Das' personal search for dharma in the ancient epic uncovers buried signposts to a desirable future polity. The Difficulty of Being Good is a significant Indian contribution to a new, universal Enlightenment that is not Western in origin or character. It is a delight to read a book that wears its learning so elegantly and presents its arguments with such panache.'' <br>--Sudhir Kakar, author and psychoanalyst <br> <br><p></p><br>''It took me on a huge intellectual and emotional journey. And with Gurcharan Das as guide, even familiar paths seemed to lead through fresh landscapes....The secular humanism and intellectual humility that shines through this beautiful book shows that--along with everything else--the Mahabharata can provide just what the modern world needs. Das' rehabilitation of Yudhishthira is inspiring...showing convincingly that [others] misunderstand his role. I came away feeling more whole.'' <br>--Dr. Ian Proudfoot, Sanskrit scholar, Australian National University <br> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Difficulty of Being Good</em> represents an attempt by Das to bring together the two sides of his life, the literary and the practical. The result is a highly personal and idiosyncratic, yet richly insightful meditation on the application of ancient philosophy to <br>issues of modern moral conduct and right and wrong."--William Dalrymple, <em>The Financial Times</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet</h2><p>Possibly the most graphic treatment of global warming that has yet been published, <i>Six Degrees</i> is what readers of Al Gore's best-selling <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> or Ross Gelbspan's <i>Boiling Point</i> will turn to next.

Based on this forecast, author Mark Lynas outlines what to expect from a warming world, degree by degree. At 1 degree Celsius, most coral reefs and many mountain glaciers will be lost. A 3-degree rise would spell the collapse of the Amazon rainforest, disappearance of Greenland's ice sheet, and the creation of deserts across the Midwestern United States and southern Africa. A 6-degree increase would eliminate most life on Earth, including much of humanity.<br><br>Based on authoritative scientific articles, the latest computer models, and information about past warm events in Earth history, <i>Six Degrees</i> promises to be an eye-opening warning that humanity will ignore at its peril.</p><p>Mark Lynas, a journalist, campaigner, and broadcast commentator on environmental issues, is the author of <i>High Tide: News from a Warming World.</i> He is a contributor to periodicals including <i>New Statesman, Ecologist, Granta,</i> and <i>Geographical,</i> and to the <i>Guardian</i> and <i>Observer</i> newspapers in the United Kingdom.Adult/High School&#x2014;Lynas has gathered global-warming information from an array of authoritative scientists: geologists, glaciologists, oceanographers, climate scientists, and paleoclimatologists, as well as "major scientific projections" from computer modelers. He divides his findings into six main chapters representing the consequences of a one- to six-degree shift in temperature rise. More factual than hysterical and using accessible language, the author portrays a sobering, but broad and fascinating, view of the problem. He discusses not only the environmental consequences of melting icecaps, ocean warming, coral reef bleaching, CO2 emissions, deforestation, and severe weather, but also cultural and economic reverberations-the result of population shifts, animal migrations, and societal collapse. Through computer-modeling simulations he looks back into the past (the Pliocene, the Mayan civilization) and projects into the future for CO2 comparisons. His premise: the problem is now at global scale and will not just impact the disappearance of one group alone as it did the Maya. Claiming that solutions must be political, and that it is too late for quick fixes using renewable energy sources or technology, he concludes with some cautionary possible solutions: relocalization of goods and services, less consumption, global-scale carbon rationing, and a "2 degree increase target." Anyone studying climate change will find this a helpful reference as much current research has been precompiled and interpreted within one resource.&#x2014;<i>Jodi Mitchell, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

To the extent possible, he has made a science of understanding how the US economy works almost as a living organism--how it grows and changes, surges and stalls. He has made a particular study of the question of productivity growth, at the heart of which is the riddle of innovation. Where does innovation come from, and how does it spread through a society? And why do some eras see the fruits of innovation spread more democratically, and others, including our own, see the opposite?<br><br>In <i>Capitalism in America</i>, Greenspan distills a lifetime of grappling with these questions into a thrilling and profound master reckoning with the decisive drivers of the US economy over the course of its history. In partnership with the celebrated Economist journalist and historian Adrian Wooldridge, he unfolds a tale involving vast landscapes, titanic figures, triumphant breakthroughs, enlightenment ideals as well as terrible moral failings. Every crucial debate is here--from the role of slavery in the antebellum Southern economy to the real impact of FDR's New Deal to America's violent mood swings in its openness to global trade and its impact. But to read <i>Capitalism in America</i> is above all to be stirred deeply by the extraordinary productive energies unleashed by millions of ordinary Americans that have driven this country to unprecedented heights of power and prosperity. <br><br>At heart, the authors argue, America's genius has been its unique tolerance for the effects of creative destruction, the ceaseless churn of the old giving way to the new, driven by new people and new ideas. Often messy and painful, creative destruction has also lifted almost all Americans to standards of living unimaginable to even the wealthiest citizens of the world a few generations past. A sense of justice and human decency demands that those who bear the brunt of the pain of change be protected, but America has always accepted more pain for more gain, and its vaunted rise cannot otherwise be understood, or its challenges faced, without recognizing this legacy. For now, in our time, productivity growth has stalled again, stirring up the populist furies. There's no better moment to apply the lessons of history to the most pressing question we face, that of whether the United States will preserve its preeminence, or see its leadership pass to other, inevitably less democratic powers.</p><p><b>Alan Greenspan</b>&nbsp;was born in 1926 and reared in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City.

Tops in her field, Eve obsesses over recreating the likenesses of faceless, decomposed murder victims, using only their bare skulls as a guide. It's a spooky career that began when Eve's own daughter, Bonnie, vanished and was later discovered, the girl's remains unrecognizable. <p> In <i>Body of Lies</i>, a killer uncovers a shocking truth about Bonnie, driving a rattled Eve to take a dangerous assignment in the darkest heart of bayou country. There, at the weird behest of a shady senator, Eve rebuilds the visage of the politician's late rival, a challenge that nearly results in her murder, strains her romance with a hard-bitten detective, and uncovers a fantastic global conspiracy over energy profits and much else. Wildly ambitious, Iris Johansen's <i>Body of Lies</i> inspires paranoia about the rich and powerful, though it gets unwieldy when Johansen's action writing and characters don't plausibly sustain the image of a secret society hell-bent on world domination. More effective are her bright supporting characters (especially Eve's Liverpudlian protector, Galen), bursts of descriptive wit, and insights into her wounded but dogged heroine. <i>--Tom Keogh</i></p>A past she thought buried...a murder she was driven to solve... <br>Forensic sculptor Eve Duncan has been summoned to Baton Rouge by a high-ranking government official to identify the remains of an unknown murder victim.

I quickly changed out of my NASA pajamas and into my favorite black crop top and dark-blue vintage jeans, liking the way they accentuated my curves. According to Mom no one needed to know that I had boobs, much less a belly button, except for me, Allah, and my future husband.

Cutting through the media confusion over new Gospel finds, Perkins&#x2019;s <i>Introduction to the Synoptic Gospels</i> presents a balanced, responsible look at how the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke came to be and what they mean.</p><p>Pheme Perkins is professor of New Testament in the TheologyDepartment at Boston College. Among her many publishedbooks are Reading the New Testament, Gnosticism and theNew Testament, Galatians and the Politics of Faith andPeter: Apostle for the Whole Church.<b>John P. Meier</b><br> &#x2014; University of Notre Dame<br> "Pheme Perkins has dedicated her career to communicating her professional expertise in both the New Testament and the Gnostic Gospels to her students in the classroom and to a wider audience of interested clergy and educated laity. Now she distills both her vast knowledge and her teaching skills in this book on the Synoptic Gospels. But the scope of this volume is much broader than the standard introduction to the Synoptics. Perkins situates the Synoptics within the wider contexts of the composition and function of books in the ancient Greco-Roman world, the development of the idea of a New Testament canon, and the continuation of the Gospel genre in the Gospels of the second and third centuries. College and university professors will welcome this volume as a valuable teaching tool."<br><br><b>Adela Yarbro Collins</b><br> &#x2014; Yale University<br> "This book not only provides a much-needed general introduction to the Synoptic Gospels but also introduces its audience to the apocryphal Gospels, including the Gospel of Judas. Perkins's treatment is fair and balanced, and her analogies to contemporary culture are inspired and illuminating."<br><br><b>Margaret M. Mitchell</b><br> &#x2014; University of Chicago Divinity School<br> "Pheme Perkins provides an accessibly written, evenhanded, and carefully reasoned guide to major issues in Gospel studies. In economical fashion she enables the reader to gain a sure understanding of the place of Synoptic and apocryphal Gospels in ancient literary culture and in the development of early Christianity. Highly recommended."<br><br><b>Daniel J. Harrington, S.J.</b><br> &#x2014; Weston Jesuit School of Theology<br> "Pheme Perkins provides a comprehensive and up-to-date discussion of each Synoptic Gospel and a balanced analysis of all the apocryphal and Gnostic Gospels that have attracted so much attention recently. Her knowledge of the ancient texts, long experience as a teacher, sound judgment, and clarity of expression make this book a reliable guide for college and seminary students and for all who are perplexed about the Gospels and the development of early Christianity."<br><br><b>Church of England Newspaper</b><br> "Perkins' book is an excellent resource that deserves to be read widely. . .

Sprawson compares the meaning various societies have assigned to swimming&#x2014;from classical Greece and imperial Rome to nineteenth-century England and Germany and the U.S. and Japan in the last fifty years. Sprawson gives us fascinating glimpses of the great swimmer heroes: Byron leaping dramatically into the surf at Shelley&#x2019;s beach funeral; Edgar Allen Poe&#x2019;s lone and mysterious river-swims; Rupert Brooke swimming naked with Virginia Woolf; Hart Crane swallow-diving to his death in the Bay of Mexico; Johnny Weismuller as athlete and entertainer. Informed by the literature of Swinburne, Goethe, Scott Fitzgerald, and Yukio Mishima; the films of Reifenstahl and Vigo; the Hollywood &#x201c;swimming musicals&#x201d; of the 1930s; and delving in and out of Olympic history, Haunts of the Black Masseur is a celebration of swimming that explores aspects of culture in a heretofore unimagined way.</p><p>An exploration of the meaning that different cultures have attached to water, from the god-like Greeks to Virginia Woolf to Mark Spitz.

(The West hand remains the same and the other three hands are chosen randomly.) The software then plays these deals automatically, seeing which of the 13 possible opening leads works best at both IMPs (rubber bridge/Chicago) and match-point pairs. By analysing the results, the authors pass on to the reader the secrets of finding the best lead against notrump contracts on a wide range of different auctions.</p><p>Writing this book, with my long-time friend and previous bridge partner Taf Anthias,&nbsp;required way more effort than most of my other books. We spent over a year running computer simulations, accumulating the results and deciding which lead problems to include in the book. When we spotted an unexpected result, for example a doubleton or singleton lead being rated best against 3NT, we tried to analyse the reason for this.&nbsp;It involved wading through the many thousands of 52-card deals in the simulation output, trying to determine why a particular lead was working better than others.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, it was hard work, but it was also great fun to be writing a book that was so different from anything that had been done before.&nbsp;The publisher did not think that there would be a wide audience for such an academic book. He was very surprised, as we have been, at the book's success. Yesterday, more than a year after the book's publication, it was ranked 3rd&nbsp;in Amazon USA's Bridge Top 100 listing. Hurray!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the start of this month (November 2012) Masterpoint Press published our 'Winning Suit Contract Leads'. This follows exactly the same format as 'Winning Notrump Leads'.&nbsp;It investigates the best leads against suit part-scores, games, small slams and grand slams. Again we found many surprising results.&nbsp;For example, leads from a doubleton (particularly two low cards) were much more highly rated than most players would expect. Leads from a jack were not so bad as everyone says. Trump leads were generally quite awful. Should you lead an ace against a small slam? You will have to read the book to find out!</p><h2>Seventy-Four Tools for Good Living: Reflections on the Fourth Chapter of Benedict&#x2019;s Rule</h2><p>There is more in Benedict&#x2019;s Rule than meets the eye. Based on the rules of life of John Cassian and Saint Basil, Benedict invites us to go further back to the scriptural basis of all Christian and monastic living and pursue our spiritual journey by the guidance of the Gospel.This book of reflections on the tools for good living is intended to be read very slowly, one section at a time. In addition to communicating reflections on each verse of chapter 4, Casey invites readers to:�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue the process of reflection for themselves�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; apply what is written to their own lives�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draw on their own wisdom and insight�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and, ultimately, broaden their experience of monastic spirituality<br></p><p><p>Michael Casey, OCSO, has been a monk of Tarrawarra Abbey (Australia) since 1960. In the intervening years he has conducted many retreats and workshops on every continent (except Antarctica) and has written many articles on topics relating to monastic history and spirituality. He is also the author of many books, including <i>The Road to Eternal Life: Reflections on the Prologue of Benedict's Rule </i>and <i>Seventy-Four Tools for Good Living: Reflections on the Fourth Chapter of Benedict&#x2019;s Rule</i>, both from Liturgical Press.</p>&#x201c;Ancient monastic authors often stressed their wish to be of useto readers. Like them, Michael Casey has written a <i>useful</i> volume, a volume to live by. Drawing on a wealth of sources, and reading deeply in the book of experience, he shows what a vast perspective is indicated in the &#x2018;little Rule&#x2019; of Benedict, what fullness of life is in store for those who follow it with courage and coherence.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric Varden, OCSO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mount Saint Bernard Abbey<br><i>&#x201c;Tolle lege</i> (pick up this book) if you want a sustained conversation with a master teacher of the Rule of Benedict.

He manages to marry faith commitment to pastoral common sense in such a manner that monks and laity as well can find answers to that request made to the old desert dwellers: Give me a good word. Casey, in fact, gives us many good words.&#x201d;Lawrence S. CunninghamJohn A. O'Brien Professor of Theology (Emeritus)The University of Notre Dame<br>&#x201c;In my regular university course on the Rule of St. Benedict as a mirror to present-day culture there is close reading of some chapters of the Rule. To my shame I tended to neglect chapter four a bit. Michael Casey&#x2019;s deep reflections in this remarkable book are nourished by a half century of monastic reading and deep psychological and existential insight. I can now draw from nearly 300 pages of wisdom on the fourth chapter of Benedict&#x2019;s Rule. Just to quote from Fr. Michael&#x2019;s preface: &#x2018;There is much more in Benedict&#x2019;s Rule than meets the superficial eye.&#x2019;&#x201d; Wil Derkse<br>Andreas van Melsen Chair for Science, Society and Worldviews (retired)<br>Catholic Radboud University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands<br>"This book is not an exegetical study; one goes elsewhere for such. Rather this is a wisdom text, exploring each tool in a search to comprehend these pithy sayings for good living. . . . It is his own lived experience that brightens up the text.

Rippling with satire and humor, Mildred&#x2019;s outspoken accounts vividly capture her white employers&#x2019; complacency and condescension&#x2014;and their startled reactions to a maid who speaks her mind and refuses to exchange dignity for pay.<br><br>Upon publication the book sparked a critique of working conditions, laying the groundwork for the contemporary domestic worker movement. Although she was critically praised, Childress&#x2019;s uncompromising politics and unflinching depictions of racism, classism, and sexism relegated her to the fringe of American literature. <i>Like One of the Family</i> has been long overlooked, but this new edition, featuring a foreword by best-selling author Roxane Gay, will introduce Childress to a new generation.</p><p>&#39;Like one of the Family celebrates the image of black women most common to their history and suggests that they are no less dignified for having spent time on their knees.

This consciousness of 'two worlds' led to a great many questions in Flo, and some rebellion&#x2015;which culminated two nights before her First Communion in suddenly questioning whether she should receive the Sacrament at all.</p><p>Sensing the precarious nature of faith in an overwhelmingly secular world, Read, through meditation and anecdote, began writing down the compelling reasons for holding onto both God and Church. Taking the Annunciation as her template (that most fundamental yes to God), she explores common experiences of the spiritual life: His presence and invitation (And he came to her); the fears we have to let go of (Do not be afraid); the realization of our identity in God (Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord) and what our vocation might be (Let it be to me according to your word); and when God feels very distant from us (And the angel departed from her).</p><p>Drawing on Scripture, lives of the saints, and the lives of people she has known personally and professionally as a nurse, Read shows how God is with us always&#x2015;through suffering, spiritual dryness and depression, as well as in joyful and mystical ways. This book was inspired by a mother's loving response to a daughter&#x2015;but what has resulted is something that will speak to any believer engaged in the bliss and bewilderment of a relationship with God.</p></p><p><p><b>Sally Read</b> is the author of three books of poetry published by Bloodaxe Books.

At the 500th anniversary of John Calvin's birth, new generations have discovered and embraced a "New Calvinism," finding in the Reformed tradition a rich theological vision. In fact, <i>Time </i>cited New Calvinism as one of "10 Ideas Changing the World Right Now." This book provides pastoral and theological counsel, inviting converts to this tradition to find in Calvin a vision that's even bigger than the New Calvinism might suggest. Offering wisdom at the intersection of theology and culture, noted Reformed philosopher James K. A. Smith also provides pastoral caution about pride and maturity. The creative letter format invites young Calvinists into a faithful conversation that reaches back to Paul and Augustine, through Calvin and Edwards, extending to Kuyper and Wolterstorff. Together they sketch a comprehensive vision of Calvinism that is generous, winsome, and imaginative.</p><p><b>Exploring the Riches of the Reformed Tradition<br></b><br>"I wish there had been a Jamie Smith to write letters like these to me when I was a young Calvinist. This is a wise and delightfully written portrayal of a robust Calvinism for the twenty-first century."--<b>Richard J. Mouw</b>, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"James K. A. Smith winsomely steps into one of the most fascinating conversations in contemporary evangelicalism--the surprising resurgence of Calvinism among younger Christians. <i>Letters to a Young Calvinist</i> is thoughtful, nuanced, provocative, relational, and informed. No one will agree with everything here, but what I appreciated most was Smith's careful insistence that there's much more to being theologically Reformed than believing in the famous (and fabulous!) five points of Calvinism. A thoroughly engaging read!"--<b>Tullian Tchividjian</b>, author, <i>Surprised by Grace: God's Relentless Pursuit of Rebels<br><br></i>"Jamie Smith has done a fabulous job articulating a winsome and engaging account of the depth, splendor, and joy of the Reformed tradition. I found much of what I hold dear about Calvinism reaffirmed in these interesting letters and at the same time was delighted to learn new insights that got me excited about the tradition all over again. I hope this book introduces a whole new generation to the richness of the Reformed understanding of the faith."--<b>Jim Belcher</b>, author, <i>Deep Church: A Third Way Beyond Emerging and Traditional<br><br></i>"Most of the time I cheered 'Amen!' as I read these letters, but even when I disagreed, I appreciated Jamie's model of charity and humility as well as conviction. In the midst of all the encouraging energy of the 'New Calvinism' movement, it is also important to say that being Reformed is more than TULIP. These are rewarding and creatively written letters for all of us."--<b>Michael Horton</b>, Westminster Seminary California<br><br>"A splendid book that speaks to both head and heart, counseling the 'young, restless, and Reformed' toward growth into a wider and deeper Reformed tradition. . . .

In these writings, Vital describes the teachings of his master, Isaac Luria, who is one of the most important figures within modern Kabbalah. Much of the Kabbalah today is based on the teachings of Luria. However, Luria wrote very little during his life. Consequently, Vital is considered to be the primary source and chief interpreter of the teachings of Luria. The Tree of Life is considered to be the most authoritative version of Luria&#x2019;s teachings. The Palace of Adam Kadmon is the first volume of the Tree of Life. In it, Vital describes the creation of the universe. Vital first describes the creation in general and then proceeds to describe it in great detail.

They were widely blamed on extremist Muslims and their backers and used to support the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. They were also used to justify and hasten the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, which was being presented to Congress just as the first anthrax victim grew ill. In October 2001, one of the hypotheses that gained ground was that of the Double Perpetrator, the claim that al-Qaeda was carrying out the attacks with the support of Iraq. Much evidence was put forth to support this Double Perpetrator hypothesis but independent scientists soon discovered that the anthrax spores came from a domestic lab in the US serving the military and intelligence communities, not from al-Qaeda or Iraq. The FBI then quickly claimed that an individual was responsible for the attacks and began noisily looking for this &#x201c;lone wolf.&#x201d; In 2008 the Bureau named Dr. Bruce Ivins of the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease as the &#x201c;anthrax killer.&#x201d; Although the FBI remains committed to the Ivins hypothesis, the case has been disintegrating for the last three years. Currently, it is justly held in contempt not merely by scientists who worked with Ivins but by many journalists as well as several US senators. But this raises the question: if Ivins did not commit this crime, who did? This book presents evidence to support the following points: (a) The anthrax attacks were carried out by a group of perpetrators, not by a &#x201c;lone wolf.&#x201d; The attacks were, therefore, the result of a conspiracy&#x2014; by definition a plan by two or more people, made in secret and resulting in an immoral or illegal act. (b) The group that carried out this crime consisted, in whole or in part, of insiders deep within the US state apparatus. (c) These insiders were the same people who planned the 9/11 attacks (d) The anthrax attacks were meant to facilitate a seizure of power by the executive branch of government through intimidation of Congress and US civil society. They were also designed to achieve public acquiescence to and support for the redefinition of US foreign policy, replacing the Cold War with a new and aggressive global conflict framework, the Global War on Terror.</p><p>Graeme MacQueen received his Ph.D. in Buddhist Studies from Harvard University and taught in the Religious Studies Department of McMaster University for 30 years.

For example, the FBI had claimed that Ivins could not account for extra hours in the lab in the evenings and weekends prior to the anthrax mailings. He was, they claimed, using this time to prepare the anthrax for the attacks. Such extra time in the lab at night was, they added, unprecedented in his work history.42 But investigators for PBS Frontline, ProPublica and McClatchy Newspapers found that Ivins was, in fact, doing valid and important work at the lab during the times in question. They also found that the number of night hours in the lab that had been called anomalous by the FBI were not so unusual</p><h2>On the Run in Ancient China (The Time Travel Guides, 3)</h2><p>It's the tantalizing smell of Chinese food that's enticed the Binkerton children back into the creepy Good Times Travel Agency.

She had a bad attitude.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you plan to do about her?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing really,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;because we need her to run the store. She knows the business better than the others.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So if she quit tomorrow, would we shut down the store?&#x201d;</p><p>My dad chuckled and said, &#x201c;Heck, no.&#x201d; He then mentioned that when she called, he cringed at seeing her number. He didn&#x2019;t like going to visit the store when she was there because it was such a &#x201c;beatdown&#x201d; (that&#x2019;s Texan for &#x201c;misery&#x201d;).</p><p>&#x201c;Dad, if you can&#x2019;t stand this person because she has a bad attitude, and you are the boss, imagine what her coworkers think or, even worse, our clients.&#x201d;</p><p>Like too many business owners and leaders, my dad was avoiding dealing with this person for all the wrong reasons. He said he had talked to her about her attitude and had even written her up for it. What he really needed to do was deal with her once and for all, but he never took that final step because he still believed he needed her. I encouraged him to have one last meeting with her to make her immediately change her attitude or know we would immediately take the steps to terminate her. He finally did, and the employee decided she would be a better fit outside the organization. Did the store close as she left, taking all our dry cleaner experience with her? Of course not. The store stayed open, my father put in place a new manager with the right attitude, and business improved&#x2014;both outside and inside. In fact, several employees and clients came to my father soon after and said, &#x201c;Finally! What took you so long?&#x201d;</p><p>In not dealing with this bad employee, my father, like so many business leaders, violated two of the five essential coaching principles that demonstrate two of the crucial differences between managing and coaching: No individual is more important than the team, and never avoid conflict. Then again, most businesses and their leaders, especially when things aren&#x2019;t going poorly, don&#x2019;t deal with problems like these or any others that may lurk below the surface. The expression &#x201c;high water covers all rocks&#x201d; comes to mind. But when things get rough&#x2014;when the water recedes and the rocks appear&#x2014;most leaders have little idea how to act effectively, pull their people together, and coach them as a team to perform better. They work in management cultures where leading means stepping back and letting people do their jobs, for better or worse. No need to rock the boat now. It will be high tide again soon, right? Maybe not.</p><p>This is a major reason I call the management-culture mentality fundamentally corrupt. Hire good people and let them do their jobs? That&#x2019;s a line handed down from outdated business books more than a generation old. Leaders today need to get involved and coach their teams to success, rather than manage them to mediocrity. Today&#x2019;s business isn&#x2019;t so much about today&#x2019;s economy as it is about today&#x2019;s leadership: Who is taking responsibility to actually lead? Technology and the competition move faster than ever before, and leaders need to implement a system for improvement and challenge their teams to compete at the speed of business today. Simply managing people and relying on them to develop themselves is not enough anymore. I&#x2019;m not saying those management cultures were wrong for yesterday&#x2019;s business or that they can&#x2019;t work today; they just don&#x2019;t give leaders the best chance to succeed the way coaching cultures do. Yet most leaders don&#x2019;t understand what it means to coach, the differences between managing and coaching, or before all that, what it means to be a great leader.</p><p><b>The Characteristics of Great Leaders</b></p><p>Great leaders are ethical, compassionate, and humble. They are great students and constantly strive to learn more. They are empathetic but not sympathetic, show resolve in the toughest times, and believe they can get something out of everybody, never dismissing anyone outright. Great leaders are strong and decisive without being arrogant. They never use fear to make the team fall in line, or use bravado to compensate for a fear of being vulnerable. Instead, they use vulnerability and humility to gain respect while still exuding confidence.</p><p>Great leaders always believe in themselves and their teams&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how they get the teams&#x2019; individual members to sacrifice for the good of those teams. The teams know these leaders make them better and thus strive to please them. As a result, great leaders have a loyal&#x2014;even blind&#x2014;followership. In short, their teams love and trust them and their vision. But the ability to create a vision alone does not make a great leader&#x2014;the ability to have it, communicate it, and get people to act on it does. When companies want people to communicate their visions or missions, they put them on cards, coffee mugs, posters, and newsletters. Great leaders know that stuff goes only so far. They know they must get their teams to do more than read those words. They must get them to believe in those words and make them part of the team&#x2019;s everyday vocabulary without ever thinking about it.</p><p><b>Great Leaders versus Great Coaches</b></p><p><b>The differences between great leaders and great leaders who are coaches lie in their activities and actions.</b> Leaders who don&#x2019;t do the proactive activities and actions of coaching covered in Part Two of this book are not coaches. Leaders who choose to sit back and develop their people through reactive management activities designed to maintain the status quo are not coaching. They may have the potential to be a coach but not if they continue to sit back, refuse to get more deeply and proactively involved with their people, and say things like &#x201c;My employees don&#x2019;t want me telling them how to do their job, and I don&#x2019;t want to do that!&#x201d; Unfortunately, this line is just one of the excuses leaders make for not taking the time to coach.</p><p>For the record, leaders who are coaches are more engaged with their teams, but they are not always in their employees&#x2019; faces, getting in the way for the sake of getting involved and micromanaging everything all the time (although micromanaging is a coaching tool and can be approached positively, as we will see later on). Coaches just don&#x2019;t fear involvement as they make sure employees doing their &#x201c;thing&#x201d; are aligned with the team&#x2019;s &#x201c;thing.&#x201d; Yet understanding this and saying you&#x2019;re ready to learn and implement the skills necessary to coach won&#x2019;t mean much if you don&#x2019;t understand the differences between managing and coaching. Turning managers into coaches begins not with action and activities but with accepting the fundamental differences between managing and coaching.</p><p><b>The Five Crucial Ways Managing Differs from Coaching</b></p><ol><li><b>Belief in the team:</b> Coaches believe in a team culture and the need to be connected to that team constantly so everyone performs better. Managers focus on individuals and then disconnect to let them &#x201c;just do their jobs.&#x201d;</li><li><b>Conflict management:</b> Coaches make use of conflict to move team members up in the organization or out. Managers try to avoid conflict.</li><li><b>Involvement:</b> Coaches get involved before action is needed (to prevent problems from developing). Managers react and get involved only when they are needed (when there is a problem and often too late).</li><li><b>Employee focus:</b> Coaches focus on top performers (those who deserve attention). Managers focus on poor performers (those who need attention).</li><li><b>Team building:</b> Coaches are always practicing and scrimmaging to make their teams better. Managers rarely practice.</li></ol><p>Now let&#x2019;s translate these differences into the five essential principles of coaching every coach must follow.</p><p><b>The Five Essential Principles of Coaching</b></p><ol><li>Make the team more important than any individual.</li><li>Don&#x2019;t avoid conflict&#x2014;use it!</li><li>Act before a response is needed.</li><li>Pay attention to top performers and focus on making more of them.</li><li>Mandate EVERYBODY to practice.</li></ol><p>Every one of these principles informs the coaching activity chapters in Part Two of this book. Skill practice, making tough decisions, rewards and recognitions, building your bench, game plans, setting goals, peer presentations . . . all of them require coaches to appreciate the importance of these principles. So let&#x2019;s take the time to discuss them in a little more depth, especially the first one, which will be the biggest shock for most leaders who are managers.</p><p><b>Coaching Principle #1</b></p><p>Make the team more important than any individual</p><p>Think about those star athletes who were or are great players but have bad attitudes that alienate their teammates, coaches, owners, and fans. Their talent may be undeniable, but so is their unlikability. They put themselves above everyone, and despite putting up some big numbers and occasionally playing in championship games, they rarely lead their teams to the ultimate victory. Most of these players, despite their God-given talent and gaudy stats, eventually destroy the team&#x2019;s chemistry, and unless bound by a long-term contract their teams now regret, those teams release them, again and again. Sure, they usually sign somewhere else. Other teams and coaches try to work with them, thinking the results they generate may offset any personal problems. Maybe these players mature. Maybe they find the coaches who can turn them around. But usually those players aren&#x2019;t about contributing to the success of anyone but himself or herself and are eventually let go again.</p><p>In business, we have the same superstars with good results and bad attitudes. Problem is, we don&#x2019;t usually fire people like that or even confront them; we leave them alone. Even when their results decline a bit. Even when the team can&#x2019;t stand them. Even when we can&#x2019;t stand them. We isolate them so they can &#x201c;do their job&#x201d; and not annoy the team. We effectively say to them, &#x201c;Hey, you don&#x2019;t play very well with others, but you make me money, so I&#x2019;m going to let you do your thing, keep you away from the team, and not push you to do anything outside your comfort zone. Carry on!&#x201d; A lot of times, we actually try to give these people more responsibility as a &#x201c;reward.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s like rewarding an irresponsible child: My kid keeps slacking on his responsibilities, so I&#x2019;m going to teach him how to be responsible by letting him babysit his little sister. Not a good plan.</p><p></p></p><h2>Silent Warriors, Incredible Courage: The Declassified Stories of Cold War Reconnaissance Flights and the Men Who Flew Them</h2><p><p>The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 took the American military by surprise. Rushing to respond, the US and its allies developed a selective overflight program to gather intelligence. <i>Silent Warriors, Incredible Courage </i>is a history of the Cold War overflights of the Soviet Union, its allies, and the People's Republic of China, based on extensive interviews with dozens of pilots who flew these dangerous missions. </p><p>In 1954 the number of flights expanded, and the highly classified SENSINT program was born. Soon, American RB-45C, RB-47E/H, RF-100s, and various versions of the RB-57 were in the air on an almost constant basis, providing the president and military leadership with hard facts about enemy capabilities and intentions. Eventually the SENSINT program was replaced by the high-flying U-2 spy plane. The U-2 overflights removed the mysteries of Soviet military power. These flights remained active until 1960 when a U-2 was shot down by Russian missiles, leading to the end of the program. Shortly thereafter planes were replaced by spy satellites. </p><p>The overflights were so highly classified that no one, planner or participant, was allowed to talk about them&#x2015;and no one did, until the overflight program and its pictorial record was declassified in the 1990s. Through extensive research of existing literature on the overflights and interviews conducted by Wolfgang W. E. Samuel, this book reveals the story of the entire overflight program through the eyes of the pilots and crew who flew the planes. Samuel's account tells the stories of American heroes who risked their lives&#x2015;and sometimes lost them&#x2015;to protect their country.</p></p><p>The thrilling secret history of the American pilots who risked their lives to protect their country during the Cold War<br><br>This beautifully written book gives vital insight into an often overlooked but vitally important era of the Cold War, the incomparably brave reconnaissance flights by US aircraft around and into territory of the Soviet Union. It was a time when jet aircraft were new, the Cold War was blooming, and any mistakes could have been fatal. This gives the inside story from the viewpoint of the brave and incredibly skilled airmen who flew dangerous missions to keep the US safe. (Colonel Walter J. Boyne, USAF (Ret.), former Director of the National Air and Space Museum)<br><br>Here at last is an account that fills a major gap in our knowledge of those years and brings back into the picture a substantial number of Americans who risked their lives&#x2015;and sometimes lost them&#x2015;in protecting this country but who could not be publicly recognized for their great service at the time. (Dr. Gerhard L. Weinberg, professor emeritus at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II)<br><br>As readable as any adventurous spy story. This book will be a valuable contribution to the literature about American reconnaissance. (Al Stettner, docent, National Air and Space Museum)<br><br>Excellent, both in terms of structure and story.

Art. Hybrid Genre. Relentlessly original and brilliantly hybrid, MONSTER PORTRAITS investigates the concept of the monstrous through a mesmerizing combination of words and images. An uncanny and imaginative autobiography of otherness, it offers the fictional record of a writer in the realms of the fantastic shot through with the memories of a pair of Somali-American children growing up in the 1980s. Operating under the sign of two&#x2014;texts and drawings, brother and sister, black and white, extraordinary and everyday&#x2014;MONSTER PORTRAITS multiplies, disintegrates, and blends, inviting the reader to find the danger in the banal, the beautiful in the grotesque. Accumulating into a breathless journey and groundbreaking study, these brief fictions and sketches claim the monster as a fragmentary vastness: not the sum but the derangement of its parts.<br><br>Del Samatar's drawings conjure beings who drag worlds in their wake. World Fantasy Award-winning author Sofia Samatar responds with allusive, critical, and ecstatic meditations. Together they have created a secret history of the mixed-race child, a guide to the beasts of an unknown mythos, and a dreamer's iconography.

Sofia Samatar's storytelling never fails to enchant and MONSTER PORTRAITS lava-rocks Del Samatar's stunningly detailed images with the breathless depth of her vision to peek between bushes, beyond diasporas, into mirrors, and across time through the everyday monstrous grandeur--coy and aggressive, best-kept secret and plain as the second nose on a rugged face--often missed by the naked eye. Be ready to be beautifully ruined." --Samiya Bashir, author of <em>Field Theories</em><br><br>"This is a wondrous book. It reminded me of all the magical and rupturing books I have carried close to my heart, tucked against my body beneath my coat, since childhood. This is not a child's book, though it could be. The 'monstrous' life of ungulates and human-animal compositions, but also ordinary people&#x2014;the New York City 'nanny' perhaps, who snaps one day and does away with the domestic scene before her&#x2014;proliferate, exit, and enter the world of this book at intervals both soundless and without a visible depth. 'All monsters,' writes Sofia Samatar, 'express relationships: not the ones we dream of, but the ones we have.' Del Samatar's drawings, which accompany the brilliant (plainly written yet alchemical) prose of MONSTER PORTRAITS, are also astonishingly beautiful. I am so excited to hold this book in my hands, like a 'red bowl.' And drink from it or eat from it. Again and again. To this end, I am thinking of buying a new coat that fits tightly and has buttons, so that I can indeed hold it very close, in all weathers and at all times!" &#x2014;Bhanu Kapil, author of <em>Incubation: A Space for Monsters</em><br><br>"MONSTER PORTRAITS is a visually and linguistically striking book&#x2014;a moving and daring duet between an artist and a writer, between a sister and a brother. Del Samatar's illustrations of monsters are gorgeous and hauntingly human. Their faces are emotive and their bodies are fantastical and graceful. Sofia Samatar&#x2014;a dazzling and vital voice&#x2014;braids autobiography with philosophy and storytelling (folkloric and literary) to create vignettes that reveal how Otherness is always present in our art, our histories, our mirrors. Her language is riveting, visionary, and breathtakingly alive. MONSTER PORTRAITS is an immensely rewarding feast for the mind and for the eye." &#x2014;Eduardo C. Corral, author of <em>Slow Lightning</em><br><br>"The Samatars' monsters are beautiful, their panegyrics also beautiful, and beauty is the word for every strange and perfect thing that recompenses the brutalities of the world. Every excrescence is glorious here: devotion and invention cling to each other, philosophy crystallizes from asymmetries, and monsters take the form of lives turned inside out. Otherness, in this imaginary, is the foundation of togetherness, and monsters exist by their defiance of all monstrosities." &#x2014;Anne Boyer, author of <em>Garments Against Women</em></p><h2>American Murder Houses: A Coast-to-Coast Tour of the Most Notorious Houses of Homicide</h2><p><b>There are places in the United States of America where violent acts of bloodshed have occurred.

I was in the process of finishing this book on American murder houses and knew that one such house was within walking distance of where we were sitting: the home that had been owned by Gianni Versace. In fact, Versace had walked from his home to the News Caf� on the morning of July 15, 1997, and it was on his return trip that he was gunned down on his front steps by a serial killer named Andrew Cunanan. After lunch, my friend and I walked up the street toward the mansion, the same path Versace took that fateful day. Versace&#x2019;s walk would have been a little easier; he was walking on a Tuesday morning when the foot traffic would have been a bit lighter than what we encountered.</p><p>Ocean Drive along this stretch of Miami Beach is a beautiful wall of Art Deco buildings facing the water, most of them restaurants and hotels. Tucked in among them is one home: the mansion where Versace lived. The day we walked by, the mansion was being operated as an upscale hotel and restaurant. I wondered if many people would know or remember that Versace was murdered there fifteen years ago?</p><p>As we approached the house we noticed people standing in front of the mansion&#x2019;s black iron gates, posing for pictures. A security guard stood just inside the gates, keeping an eye on the visitors and the front of the building. As one group of tourists would leave, another would wander by. Invariably, the passersby would look around, pose for pictures in front of the gates, and move on. Did all these people know about Versace and that he had died here? Apparently so. There were no signs on the spot and nothing to indicate who used to own the home or who might have died here. And still, there was a steady stream of visitors to the front steps, many getting their pictures taken in front of a pair of otherwise bland-looking metal gates.</p><p>This, a decade and a half after Gianni Versace&#x2019;s murder, was a testament to the attraction of the murder house. There is no question that Americans are fascinated with murder houses and always have been. After a murder hits the news, people are seemingly drawn to the scene of the crime. One of the most common postmurder images on the news is of the curious gathered in front of a house, sometimes holding a vigil in remembrance of the dead. Some may be there to comfort survivors, and sometimes friends and relatives comfort one another. Neighbors often join those who have traveled to come see the crime scene. Eventually, the number of people in front of the home will dwindle, but the murder house will always retain a certain stigma and attract attention long after the vigils end. Nowadays, websites are devoted to murder houses, with aficionados often checking in and telling of recent visits and observations.</p><p>But what makes anyone want to go and look at a murder house, after the police tape has been removed and the reporters have moved on to other stories? It is hard to say. Americans have a fascination with crime. True-crime programs on television are quite popular and there is always a certain amount of drama in any murder case. What would drive someone to kill another person? What if the accused didn&#x2019;t do it? Imagine the horror of being charged with a crime you didn&#x2019;t commit. What about the unsolved crimes? If the murderer is still out there, will he strike again? Each murder seems to raise questions like these and more. Once the crime scenes have been studied and the trials completed, all that remains for the curious is the murder house.</p><p>This book is a collection of twenty-nine well-known murder houses from around the country. They run the spectrum of time, from the 1830s to the twenty-first century. Some were home to famous people who were murdered; others were homes for regular, nonfamous people who only became famous for how they died. In some, the killers were much more famous before the murders than the victims. Not all the crimes were solved. For example, people still argue about whether Lizzie Borden hacked her parents to death with a hatchet. Not all killers were brought to justice; many people have strong beliefs about who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, but no one was ever convicted for their murders. The Los Angeles Police Department famously announced it had no intention of looking any further for their killer; to them, the case was solved.</p><p>Some of the murder houses have murkier histories. At least one famous murder house is on lists like these only because of a hoax. The legend surrounding the house was invented from thin air; we do not know who started it or why, but today people go and look at the house where no one was murdered&#x2014; because they have heard that people were killed there in a most spectacular and gruesome manner. In that instance I explain what we do know about the home and where the story most likely sprang from. If I hadn&#x2019;t, it would have appeared to be a glaring omission to those who had heard of it but did not know it was a hoax.</p><p>Some murder houses became famous only because of books written about the murders that occurred in them. Truman Capote thrust the Clutter house of Holcomb, Kansas, into the public eye with his book In Cold Blood. The family that briefly lived in the DeFeo house in Amityville, New York, wrote a book&#x2014;which they claimed was a true story&#x2014;about their former home and how it was possessed by evil spirits. The evil spirits were not real, but the DeFeos, who had been murdered in the house before the Lutz family &#x201c;fled&#x201d; from the house, were all too real. The story of their murder house&#x2019;s alleged haunting has overshadowed the DeFeos&#x2019; own sad end.</p><p>Many other murder houses have been demolished or are long gone. A few of them are mentioned in this book but are not featured. Some probably would have been knocked down regardless of their history, but others most certainly were leveled to erase the stigma of the home&#x2019;s past. The Hale-Bopp &#x201c;Heaven&#x2019;s Gate&#x201d; house is one example. The Sharon Tate murder house was razed decades after the Manson family killed its occupants, and the home owned by John Wayne Gacy has long since been replaced with another home on the same lot where Gacy buried many of his victims. More than a few famous murder houses have burned down, some under mysterious circumstances. That of Ed Gein, for instance, burned down not long after he was arrested. Arson was suspected, and considering the gruesomeness of his crimes&#x2014;he killed and gutted one victim, and also admitted digging up and stealing bodies from the local cemetery&#x2014;no one in the community bothered to find out who did it.</p><p>As of this writing, the homes described here are still standing. The following accounts and descriptions of the most well-known American murder houses and the murders that put them on this list are as factual as possible. Each chapter is followed by a reference or two indicating a good starting place for a reader who wants to see more information on a given murder house.</p><p>Keep in mind that most of these houses are owned by private individuals who are not seeking any particular attention. Still, many of these houses can be seen without intruding onto the property. If you choose to go look at any of them, you should be careful to remain on public property. The few houses that are open for tours are noted, and, of course, you can inspect those houses to your heart&#x2019;s content. Included here are the addresses and many other details of the houses, all available from public sources with a little bit of digging. These cases were well publicized and the information is public and out there for anyone to obtain. Even so, please respect the privacy of the owners. Their homes have been through a lot.</p></p><h2>Mini-Mosaic Quilts: 30+ Block Designs � 14 Projects � Easy Piecing Technique</h2><p>Celebrate the decorative intricacy of tiled mosaics in your next quilting or sewing project.

He teaches how to paint an impression of trees, rather than showing how reproduce each leaf, and illustrates the importance of understanding shapes, perspective, light and shade, and the way foliage changes with the seasons. This is a book for all landscape artists whatever their skill levels, and anyone who wants to learn more about painting trees whether they are magnificent in their winter habitat, gloriously bedecked in spring foliage, splendid in their summer raiment or stunning when their leaves turn to russet reds and spun golds.</p><p>Terry Harrison grew up in Norfolk. His early art education was basic and he never dreamed that he would become an artist. At fifteen, Terry moved to Hampshire and was inspired by a brilliant art teacher. He took O and A levels in art, then won a place at Farnham Art School at the age of sixteen. He became a graphic artist, but continued to paint in his spare time. In 1984 Terry gave up his job to paint full time. He demonstrates to artists&#39; groups and teaches on painting holidays. He has also developed a range of his own brushes and paints. He is the author of many best selling books on painting with acrylics and watercolours. Terry now lives in the Cotswolds. www.terryharrisonart.com"Terry Harrison hits the nail right on the head with this guide.

This is particularly true in the Buddhist traditions, which unanimously state that compassion and love are the foundation of all paths of practice. To cultivate the potential for compassion and love inherent within us, it is crucial to counteract their opposing forces of anger and hatred. In <i>Perfecting Patience</i>, the Dalai Lama shows how, through the practice of patience and tolerance, we can overcome the obstacles of anger and hatred. He bases his discussion on <i>A Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life</i>, the classic work on the activities of bodhisattvas&#x2014;those who aspire to attain full enlightenment in order to benefit all beings.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book was previously published under the title <i>Healing Anger</i>.</p><p>THE DALAI LAMA is considered the foremost Buddhist leader of our time.

So she clears away the trash, checks on it every day, and brings water from the butcher shop across the street. But no roses appear. Wanda&#39;s neighbors and friends are all doubtful, but when she invites them to a tea party in her &#34;rose garden&#34; one day in June, they&#39;re in for a big surprise. Pat Brisson&#39;s warm-hearted story and Maryann Cocca-Leffler&#39;s vibrant illustrations make this book about a child&#39;s simple faith one that children will long remember.</p><p><b>Pat Brisson</b> is the author of the Christopher Award-winning <i>The Summer My Father Was Ten </i>and the author of the "Kate" books--<i>Your Best Friend, Kate</i>;&nbsp;<i>Kate Heads West</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Kate on the Coast</i>.&nbsp;She lives in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, with her husband and their four sons.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Maryann Cocca-Leffler</b> is the illustrator and author of <i>Bus Route to Boston</i> and <i>Clams All Year</i>. She lives ini Amherst, New Hampshire.Brisson ( Your Best Friend, Kate ) creates a lovable new character whose unwavering optimism transforms a rubbish-ridden vacant lot into a rose garden. Convinced that a bare thornbush is really a rosebush about to bloom, Wanda exuberantly cleans up the lot so that the bush will get more sun and air. "You'll see," she says, "in a few weeks that whole lot will be full of roses." Wanda's neighbors are skeptical: "If that's a rosebush, then I'm the queen of England," one thinks to herself; "If that's a rosebush, then I'm the king of France," the next muses privately. Still, charmed by the girl's enthusiasm, they all help her. After a month without blooms but with much camaraderie, Wanda's neighbors contribute rosebushes, and "the whole lot was filled with the biggest, most beautiful, sweetest-smelling roses that anyone had ever seen--just as Wanda had always said it would be." Cheery watercolors complement this upbeat urban tale, genially depicting the city's great variety, from a chubby butcher to a kindly old woman with nylon knee highs rolled down around her ankles.

Capturing the frustrations, cabin fever, and downright misery of her experiences, Amiry writes with elegance and humor about the enormous difficulty of moving from one place to another, the torture of falling in love with someone from another town, the absurdity of her dog receiving a Jerusalem identity card when thousands of Palestinians could not, and the trials of having her ninety-two-year-old mother-in-law living in her house during a forty-two-day curfew. With a wickedly sharp ear for dialogue and a keen eye for detail, Amiry gives us an original, ironic, and firsthand glimpse into the absurdity&#x2014;and agony&#x2014;of life in the Occupied Territories.</p></p><p><p>Suad Amiry is an architect and the founder and director of RIWAQ, Centre for Architectural Conservation, in Ramallah. She grew up in Amman, Damascus, Beirut, and Cairo, and studied architecture at the American University of Beirut and at the Universities of Michigan and Edinburgh. Amiry participated in the 1991&#x2014;1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations in Washington, D.C., and from 1994 to 1996 was assistant deputy minister and director general of the Ministry of Culture in Palestine. She is the author of several books on architecture and was awarded Italy&#x2019;s Viareggio-Versilia Prize in 2004 for this book. She lives in Ramallah.</p><b>I Was Not in the Mood<br><br> Summer 1995</b><br><br> "You kick us out of Jaffa, then wonder how come we're born elsewhere!"<br><br> These words flew out of my mouth when I opened it to answer the first in a long list of questions asked by the Israeli security officer at Lod (Tel Aviv) Airport.<br><br> I was certainly not in the mood.<br><br> It was 4:30 in the morning on a hot summer day in 1995. The almost-five-hour flight from London had fatigued me and all I wanted to do was rush out of the airport to meet Ibrahim, who had sweetly come all the way from Ramallah to pick me up at this very early hour.<br><br> My anxiety and irritation increased as the young woman at passport control slipped a pink tag into my Palestinian passport. I, of course, have no problems either with pink or with being Palestinian. But at that very moment, all I wanted was a white tag. As I had experienced many times before, pink automatically meant at least an extra hour with security officers at the airport.<br><br> Oh, how I wanted a white tag this time!<br><br> "How come you were born in Damascus?" the officer repeated, obviously neither pleased nor satisfied with my impulsive reply.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell the security officer that in 1940 my father, who had come to Beirut from Jaffa, was overwhelmed the minute he saw my Damascene mother. She was eighteen, he was thirty-three. He had graduated from the American University of Beirut some twelve years before, while she was still a student at the British Syrian Training College.<br><br> The minute he stepped inside the grandiose courtyard of her family mansion in Damascus old town and realized how rich her merchant father was, his dream of marrying this tall, dashingly beautiful woman with greenish-grey eyes started to fade. In the end, this particular dream was fulfilled, but many others were shattered, and my father and mother lived a tormented life together.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell him that in December 1978 my father had died of a heart attack in Prague while attending a writers' conference. The well-known Palestinian writer Emile Habibi was the last person to see my father alive and spend the evening with him.<br><br> I was not in the mood to inform the Israeli security officer that every time my mother got pregnant, she went back to Damascus to give birth. In 1943, 1944 and 1949, she traveled between Jerusalem and Damascus to give birth to my sisters, Arwa (now a psychologist living in Amman) and 'Anan (a sociologist now living in America), and, much later, to my brother, Ayman (a diplomat). She also traveled between Amman and Damascus, where I was born two years after that. I did not want to admit to this, as it would only complicate matters and would certainly increase the security officer's fears for Israel's security, thus prolonging the interrogation.<br><br> "Have you ever lived in Damascus?" he asked.<br><br> "No," came my brief answer.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell the officer that until the age of eighteen, when I left Amman to study architecture at the American University of Beirut, my workaholic mother, who owned a publishing and printing firm, looked forward to getting rid of her four children every summer. The very first week of our summer vacation, she sent us off to her parents' house in Damascus or to her relatives in Beirut. My brother, Ayman, and I were more than happy to spend part of the summer vacation with our unmarried aunts, Nahida and Suad (for whom I was named), who completely spoiled us and my two teenage sisters. They took us to pick cherries at my aunt Farizeh's summer house in the Syrian resort town of Zabadani, up in the mountains some twenty-five miles west of Damascus. On Fridays we helped my aunts pack food and watermelons, in preparation for a picnic in one of the many restaurants along the Barada River (which became filled with watermelons that were being chilled), in the lush Damascus neighborhood of Dummar. One of the highlights of our summer vacation was the Damascus International Fair, where Aunt Nahida always bought us what she thought were the latest Russian products: a set of wooden dolls (matryoshka) for me, and wooden cars and planes for Ayman. When she ran out of ideas, Aunt Nahida took us for a stroll in the busy Suq el-Hamadiyyeh, where we quenched our thirst with sticky pistachio and gum arabic ice cream from the Bukdash ice-cream parlor. Some forty years later, I can still remember the taste of gum arabic. In the afternoons, while my aunts were having their siesta, we played and ran around the huge water fountain in the middle of the ed-dyar (courtyard) with our many cousins. But our summer vacation would not have been complete without a visit to Beirut. After a few days of continuous nagging, my two aunts always agreed to accompany us, or sometimes sent us alone, to stay with Uncle Mamduh and Aunt Firdaus in the neighborhood of Zquaq el-Balat.<br><br> To avoid our bad-tempered Uncle Mamduh, we spent most of the day swimming off the crowded St. George's Hotel beach of humid and hot Beirut. At the end of our three-month vacation, and just a day or two before school started, we arrived in Amman and the first thing my mother did was complain about our dark complexions. The Damascenes had an obsession with whiteness, and did not appreciate the concept of a fashionable tan.<br><br> "Do you have relatives in Syria?"<br><br> "No." End of conversation.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell the security officer at Tel Aviv airport that my mother was the youngest in a family of eleven, and that was just her nuclear family. I did not want to scare him by saying that I had four aunts and four uncles, and more than twenty cousins. They and their families all lived in Damascus.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell the Israeli officer that from 1950 until today, my mother's groceries had been delivered weekly from Damascus. It was impossible to convince my mother that Amman had good meat, vegetables or fruit. This was also the case when she lived in Salt and Jerusalem. The only time she bought local produce was in 1968, when we lived in Cairo. She often complained that the Egyptian Airlines pilots were not as cooperative as the taxi drivers between Damascus and Amman.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell him that Damascus is not, as he seemed to think, just one huge military base filled with SAM-1 and SAM-2 missiles, but rather a vibrant city, especially our neighborhood in the old town where my grandfather's house still stands.<br><br> It would have been difficult for me to explain to the Israeli security officer that I have always envied my parents, and even my grandparents, for living at a time when residing in, or traveling between, the beautiful cities of the region was not such a big deal and did not call for security checks. I was always intrigued when my father described his trips between Jaffa and Beirut, which included lunch at a seaside restaurant in Sidon. I was even more intrigued when my mother described to me how in 1926, as a child of four, she had visited her mother's family, the Abdulhadis, in the village of 'Arrabeh in Palestine. I have always been enchanted by the route they took between Damascus and 'Arrabeh, which went down through the Yarmouk valley and the beautiful plains of Marj Ibin 'Amer and Sahel Jenin. "First we went to our relatives in Nablus, and a few days later we went on horses to the village of 'Arrabeh," my mother would say. It was the horse ride which fascinated my mother, whereas it was the very impossibility of taking such a trip between 'Arrabeh and Damascus now which bothered me more.<br><br> The security man handed me and my passport over to a security woman sitting in a room behind a desk, then disappeared, leaving me alone with her.<br><br> She flipped through my passport, and rather aggressively asked, "And what were you doing in London?"<br><br> "I went dancing," I answered, looking her straight in the eye, with an expressionless, tired face, and a voice even more aggressive than hers.<br><br> "Do you think you're being funny?" she said, her voice louder and more serious.<br><br> "No. And do YOU have any problem with dancing?" My voice now much lower and more sarcastic.<br><br> "What was the purpose of your visit to London?"<br><br> "Dancing," I insisted.<br><br> As we went back and forth, she started to lose her temper and I started to lose my sleepiness.<br><br> A few minutes later, she picked up the phone and started talking in Hebrew, a language I do not understand.<br><br> "Dancing . . . Dancing . . . Dancing . . ."--the English word jumped out of her Hebrew sentences.<br><br> I was not in the mood to tell the Israeli security woman that I had been on vacation in Scotland with friends, friends I had not seen since 1983, when I had been working on my thesis at the University of Edinburgh.<br><br> I did not want to explain to her who these friends were. Going through their names one by one would only complicate matters and make the interrogation unbearably long.<br><br> I didn't tell her that my friendships with some of these people went back to the 1970s, and my golden university days in Beirut. Even though I was totally exhausted, I had enough common sense to realize that "Beirut" was a buzzword for the security officers of Israel. Some of those friendships went back to the fifties and sixties, during my childhood and adolescence, growing up in Amman.<br><br> As a tall and hugely built male officer (obviously her superior) entered the interrogation room, I was more certain than ever that one should never take the risk of mixing friendship with security issues, especially if it concerns the security of the State of Israel.<br><br> As the two officers exchanged a few words in Hebrew, my anxiety increased.<br><br> "What were you doing in London?" asked the male officer, extremely aggressively, while looking me straight in the eye.<br><br> "Dancing," I insisted.<br><br> "You know that failing to cooperate with us on security matters will result in your arrest?"<br><br> "Fine," I replied, quickly resigned to this ridiculous verdict, "but I need to go out and inform poor Ibrahim, who has been waiting outside the airport for hours to pick me up."<br><br> "No, you are not permitted to go; and who is Ibrahim? Is he a relative?"<br><br> I did not want to tell the two security officers that Ibrahim was not exactly a relative, as none of my relatives, and neither my husband nor any of my friends from Ramallah, are allowed to come pick me up from the airport. I wondered if the officers knew that I, like many other Palestinians living in the Occupied Territories, needed many types of permits to move about: a permit to enter Jerusalem, another to go out to Jordan, a third to enter Israel, a fourth to work in Israel, an impossible one to enter Gaza, and a four-hour permit to use the airport, which gives you just enough time to get there with no flat tires, lasamahallah (God forbid).<br><br> Ibrahim is one of two or three taxi drivers in Ramallah who happens to have a car with a yellow license plate, which allows him to pick up passengers from the airport.<br><br> I was not exactly in the mood to tell the officer that one of my dreams is simply for my husband to be able to pick me up from the airport or from Allenby Bridge when I come back from a trip. But that is a privilege no Palestinian has.<br><br> -<br><br> "You cannot prevent me from going out to tell Ibrahim to leave. It is not fair to make him wait any more, especially now that I am going to be kept here for much longer."<br><br> "No, you cannot leave!" screamed the male officer, losing his temper.<br><br> "Watch me do it," I said as I turned around and started walking out of the interrogation room into an arrivals hall filled with passengers, many of them coming to enjoy the sun and beautiful, relaxing shores of Israel. My heart was pumping as I walked towards the exit; by then, two security men were walking very close to me, one on each side. One of them kept repeating, "Don't make us do things we don't like doing."<br><br> "Yes, arresting me in front of these tourists will create a scene which is not favorable for tourism in Israel!" I screamed back. "Why can't I be treated just like any of these tourists?"<br><br> By that time, the three of us were standing outside the arrivals hall, right in front of Ibrahim, the driver.<br><br> "Elhamdullah 'ala es-salameh Suad khir inshallah shoo fi (Welcome home, Suad, what is the matter, I hope all is well)?" he said as he formally shook my hand, his eyes fixed on the two security officers.<br><br> "Where is your luggage?" he added, busy trying to figure out the story of me and the two men in civilian clothes with the hostile faces accompanying me.<br><br> "Ibrahim, these are security officers. It is a long story. In short, I am under arrest and I just came out to let you know that you should not wait for me any longer--please call Salim and tell him that I have been arrested at the airport."<br><br> "Arrested?" Ibrahim repeated, shocked.<br><br> "Don't worry, Ibrahim. It is not a big deal," I reassured him. "I have been arrested because I told them I went dancing in London," I added.<br><br> "Dancing? Did you say dancing?" Ibrahim was now in total shock.<br><br> Oh, God, that was all I needed. It seemed that Ibrahim was even more troubled by my dancing in London than the Israeli security officers. What can I say? I have always believed that the Occupation ruined the spirit of both Israelis and Palestinians.<br><br> These were the last words Ibrahim and I exchanged before one of the officers approached Ibrahim and asked him to accompany them. The three anti-dancing men disappeared inside while I stood there outside the airport with no passport and no luggage.<br><br> So much for being frivolous, Suad, I started castigating myself.<br><br> Less than half an hour later, Ibrahim appeared through the big gates of the arrivals hall, pushing my luggage trolley with one hand and waving my passport in the other. With a victorious expression on his face he said, "Come on, let's go, Suad."<br><br> "What happened, Ibrahim? Tell me."<br><br> "It takes a man to talk to men," he bragged. "Come on, Suad, let's get out of here. I just assured them that you are a bit strange."<br><br> "Ibrahim!" I bellowed.</p><h2>Garden Plants for Honey Bees</h2><p>Garden Plants for Honey Bees by Peter Lindtner is the culmination of a lifetime of photography, beekeeping, and horticulture.

People trying to lose weight usually fail, and most wind up weighing more than before. Not with EFT! Several studies show that by using the method in this book, called &#34;Clinical EFT&#34; because it&#39;s the only version of EFT validated in dozens of clinical trials, you can lose weight, and keep it off permanently. One study found that people lost an average of 11 lb. in the year after a Clinical EFT weight loss program. In this book you&#39;ll hear from dozens of people who lost weight successfully with EFT. Their deeply moving stories tell how many other parts of their lives improved too, from skin tone to marriage, from self-confidence to financial abundance. That&#39;s because EFT, also called Tapping, eliminates stress. Author Dawson Church has conducted many scientific studies of EFT. These show that Clinical EFT reduces cortisol, your main stress hormone, while lowering anxiety, depression, and pain, leading to long-term weight loss. Clinical EFT has been used successfully by thousands of people to lose those unwanted pounds without expensive drugs or risky surgery, and is your proven solution to keeping weight off permanently. When you experience the simple, powerful, science-based solutions in these pages, you&#39;ll understand why tens of thousands of people like you have made EFT for Weight Loss the best-selling book on the subject ever published.</p><p>Dawson Church, PhD, is an award-winning author whose best-selling book, The Genie in Your Genes, has been hailed as a breakthrough in the field of epigenetics.

Focusing on the oldest available texts, buttressed by data from archeology, comparative linguistics and human population genetics, Michael Witzel reconstructs a single original African source for our collective myths, dating back some 100,000 years. Identifying features shared by this "Out of Africa" mythology and its northern Eurasian offshoots, Witzel suggests that these common myths--recounted by the communities of the "African Eve"--are the earliest evidence of ancient spirituality. Moreover these common features, Witzel shows, survive today in all major religions. Witzel's book is an intellectual hand grenade that will doubtless generate considerable excitement--and consternation--in the scholarly community. Indeed, everyone interested in mythology will want to grapple with Witzel's extraordinary hypothesis about the spirituality of our common ancestors, and to understand what it tells us about our modern cultures and the way they are linked at the deepest level.<br></p><p><br><strong>E.J. Michael Witzel</strong> is Wales Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University.<br><br>"Not since Frazer's Golden Bough has anyone achieved such a grand synthesis of world mythology. Boldly swimming upstream against the present scholarly emphasis on difference and context, Witzel assembles massive evidence for a single, prehistoric, Ur-mythology. An astonishing book."--Wendy Doniger, Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago and author of <em>The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was</em><p></p><br>"[Witzel's] novel approach brings a different perspective to the myths he analyzes.

A man of average income feels he cannot be truly happy unless he owns an expensive luxury car. A dieter has an irresistible craving for ice cream. Desires often come to us unbidden and unwanted, and they can have a dramatic impact, sometimes changing the course of our lives.<br><br>In <em>On Desire</em>, William B. Irvine takes us on a wide-ranging tour of our impulses, wants, and needs, showing us where these feelings come from and how we can try to rein them in. Spicing his account with engaging observations by writers like Seneca, Tolstoy, and Freud, Irvine considers the teachings of Buddhists, Hindus, the Amish, Shakers, and Catholic saints, as well as those of ancient Greek and Roman and modern European philosophers. Irvine also looks at what modern science can tell us about desire--such as what happens in the brain when we desire something and how animals evolved particular desires--and he advances a new theory about how desire itself evolved. Irvine also suggests that at the same time that we gained the ability to desire, we were "programmed" to find some things more desirable than others. Irvine concludes that the best way to attain lasting happiness is not to change the world around us or our place in it, but to change ourselves. If we can convince ourselves to want what we already have, we can dramatically enhance our happiness.<br><br>Brimming with wisdom and practical advice, <em>On Desire</em> offers a thoughtful approach to controlling unwanted passions and attaining a more meaningful life.<br></p><p><br><strong>William B. Irvine</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Wright State University, in Dayton, Ohio.<br><br>"A sprightly and entertaining book.... Those who would like to understand and control some of their desires will be glad to find this book on the library shelf."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"What is delightful about this book is that the usual suspects are not as conspicuous. Instead, the Shakers are discussed alongside Buddha, and Diogenes adjacent to Thoreau.... With clear writing, backed up by careful exegesis and a unique twist to a common thesis, this work is necessary for most undergraduate collections, and for students of philosophy and happiness. Summing Up: Highly recommended."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"William B. Irvine has written a disarmingly seductive and easily readable treatise on the origins, nature, vicissitudes, and 'crises' of desire. He simply and clearly discusses biologically instilled incentive systems, the rich psychological research on the peculiarities of our motivation, and the wisdom of various religious and spiritual traditions. It is a well-informed, wise, informal interdisciplinary book that is highly recommended for the general reader."--Robert C. Solomon, author of <em>The Passions, About Love, The Joy of Philosophy, Not Passion's Slave</em>, and <em>In Defense of</em> <em>Sentimentality</em><p></p><br>"Irvine has given us a very engaging book on what desire is: how central it is to human existence, what science has to tell us about it, and what we can do with it and about it. He combines knowledge, wisdom and wit with a light but sure philosophical touch."--John Perry, Professor of Philosophy, Stanford University<p></p><br>"...a sweeping review of philosophical, psychological, evolutionary, and religious concepts of desire.

It is a branch of linguistics that looks less at the shape or sound of words--morphology or phonology--and more at how our words and sentences are influenced by the society around us--for instance, how the accent or the dialect we use has been shaped by where we come from or which social class we belong to. <br><br>In this Very Short Introduction, John Edwards offers the most up-to-date brief overview available of sociolinguistics, with side trips into the sociology of language and psycholinguistics. He considers such topics as the different social evaluations of languages and dialects, the loaded significance of names, and the importance of politically-driven language planning and policy. The relationship between language and gender, sexist language, the language of poverty, and the intertwining of language and religion are also dealt with here. Edwards stresses that, while linguists see all dialects as equally valid, in the wider world powerful attitudes have always placed language varieties in social hierarchies. The author also looks at language more broadly, examining the ways in which languages rise or fall, the attempts to revive flagging or endangered varieties, the reasons why some languages came to dominate others, and the special dynamics that affect contact between "big" and "small" languages.<br><br>In both its role as our most powerful tool of communication and as the most immediate symbolic marker of human affiliation, language is pre-eminently a social phenomenon. This compact volume offers an invaluable introduction to this vital aspect of language.<br><br>About the Series:<br><br>Oxford's Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative--yet always balanced and complete--discussions of the central issues in a given discipline or field.

From epidemiology and medicine to evolution and forensics, the ability to determine an organism's complete genetic makeup has changed the way science is done and the questions that can be asked of it. Its most celebrated achievement was the Human Genome Project, a technologically challenging endeavor that took thousands of scientists around the world 13 years and over three billion US dollars to complete. <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em> John Archibald explores the science of genomics and its rapidly expanding toolbox. Sequencing a human genome now takes only a few days and costs as little as $1,000. The genomes of simple bacteria and viruses can be sequenced in a matter of hours on a device that fits in the palm of your hand. The resulting sequences can be used to better understand our biology in health and disease and to "personalize" medicine. Archibald shows how the field of genomics is on the cusp of another quantum leap; the implications for science and society are profound.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

But the stylistic breadth and subcultural longevity of industrial music suggests that the common ground here might not be any one particular sound, but instead a network of ideologies. This book traces industrial music's attitudes and practices from their earliest articulations--a hundred years ago--through the genre's mid-1970s formation and its development up to the present and beyond. <br> <br>Taking cues from radical intellectuals like Antonin Artaud, William S. Burroughs, and Guy Debord, industrial musicians sought to dismantle deep cultural assumptions so thoroughly normalized by media, government, and religion as to seem invisible. More extreme than punk, industrial music revolted against the very ideas of order and reason: it sought to strip away the brainwashing that was identity itself. It aspired to provoke, bewilder, and roar with independence. Of course, whether this revolution succeeded is another question...<br> <br><em>Assimilate </em>is the first serious study published on industrial music. Through incisive discussions of musicians, audiences, marketers, cities, and songs, this book traces industrial values, methods, and goals across forty years of technological, political, and artistic change. A scholarly musicologist and a longtime industrial musician, S. Alexander Reed provides deep insight not only into the genre's history but also into its ambiguous relationship with symbols of totalitarianism and evil. Voicing frank criticism and affection alike, this book reveals the challenging and sometimes inspiring ways that industrial music both responds to and shapes the world. <br> <br><em>Assimilate </em>is essential reading for anyone who has ever imagined limitless freedom, danced alone in the dark, or longed for more noise.<br></p><p><br><strong>S.

She lives in Amarillo, Texas.<p></p>Gr 8 Up-This darker, modern update of Alice in Wonderland is more likely to please fans of Tim Burton's film adaptation than those of Lewis Carroll's novel. Alyssa, 16, is a descendant of Alice Liddell, the girl who was Carroll's inspiration for Alice. Her mother lives in a mental institution, and she herself struggles with hearing voices from insects and flowers. Do the women in her family suffer from a curse that can somehow be traced back to the original Alice? The opening chapters drag a bit, but the action picks up when Alyssa finds herself in Wonderland, fighting for her survival-and for her mother's sanity. Howard maintains a lush atmosphere throughout, reintroducing Carroll's characters as truly nightmarish monsters. Though Alyssa's ongoing quests can sometimes seem aimless and the requisite love triangle forced, teens looking for a creepy, descriptive read with a generous dollop of romance will gravitate toward this title.-Hayden Bass, Seattle Public Library, WA&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

The Askiya Muhammad administered his kingdom from Gao, Mali, although many of his most loyal followers were located in Timbuktu, Mali. The Timbuktu based scribe al hajj Mahmud Kati was a close friend of the Askiya Muhammad, who accompanied the famous Songhay leader during his pilgrimage to Mecca. The <i>Tarikh al fattash</i> is an eyewitness account of the rise and fall of the Songhay Empire, told from Kati's perspective as a key participant in many of the most important events in the era of the Askiyas. Wise's <i>The Timbuktu Chronicles, 1493-1599</i> is a translation of the Octave Houdas and Maurice Delafosse s rendition of the <i>Tarikh al fattash</i>, which was compiled from three versions of the text that surfaced in the early twentieth century, and that were edited by Houdas and Delafosse in 1913. It includes a new introduction by Wise, as well as the original introduction and scholarly notes of Houdas and Delafosse. Although long valued as the most important historical document of the medieval period, Kati's chronicle is also a literary achievement that is comparable to the writings of figures like Chaucer, Rabelais, and Montaigne. Wise's introduction and study questions accompanying this translation provide contextualizing information for the non-specialist.

Despite being given up for lost by the military brass, the 1st Marine Division fought its way out of the frozen mountains, miraculously taking thier dead and wounded with them as they ran the gauntlet of unceasing Chinese attacks.This is the gripping story that Martin Russ tells in his extraordinary book. <b>Breakout</b> is an unforgettable portrayal of the terror and courage of men as they face sudden death, making the bloody battles of the Korean hills and valleys come alive as they never have before. <br><br>Of interest will be the new PBS American Experience Documentary "The Battle of Chosin", which premiered on November 1, 2016.</p><p>Martin Russ's controversial book <i>Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950</i> tells the riveting story of how 12,000 Army personnel and Marines fought their way out of an encirclement by more than 60,000 Chinese soldiers. A Marine wounded in combat during the Korean War, Russ writes with a passion for the men who endured freezing temperatures and scaled treacherous mountains while continuing to strike the enemy as they advanced toward safety.<p> While many accounts of modern war bog readers down in a morass of military and administrative details, Russ's history so clearly distinguishes the various units, locations, and personalities that shaped the campaign that it could easily be compared with the finest novels of battle, including Michael Shaara's <i>The Killer Angels</i>. Expertly moving between American, Chinese, and Korean points of view, Russ argues that the Marines were trapped at Chosin because of the arrogance of Douglas MacArthur, the incompetence of the U.S. Army, and the disciplined planning of the Chinese generals.</p><p> Celebrated for his brilliant war memoir, <i>The Last Parallel</i>, Russ has provoked criticism for his tendency in <i>Breakout</i> to disparage the U.S. Army. However, his quotations of numerous dispatches showing Marine commanders' concern about advancing into the Chosin area, as well as his consistent portrayal of Army officers' ineptitude, lend credence to his argument that it was the particular esprit de corps of the Marines that prevented the disintegration of American forces in the freezing wastes of North Korea. <i>--James Highfill</i></p><b>Martin Russ</b>, the recipient of a Purple Heart for his service as a Marine during the Korean War, is the author of <b>The Last Parallel</b> and <b>Line of Departure</b>.

Faithfull's first hit, 1964's "As Tears Go By," opened doors to the hippest circles in London. There she frolicked with the most luminous of the young, rich, and reckless, including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Rolling Stones.<br>Her legendary affair with Mick Jagger produced one hit single, "Sister Morphine," and countless headlines. Faithfull left the relationship a strung-out junkie. Struggling to kick drugs and revive her musical career, she recorded <i>Broken English</i> in 1979, an edgy, hard-hitting, critical triumph. As honest in her autobiography as in her music, <i>Faithfull</i> is a searing, intimate portrait of a woman who examines her adventures and misadventures without flinching, without apology.</p><p>Peggy Lipton has most recently appeared onstage in "The Guys" and "The Vagina Monologues" and on television in "Alias" and the WB's "Popular," She lives in New York and Los Angeles. This is her first book. <br>David Dalton has written a number of books, including "Piece of My Heart: A Portrait of Janis Joplin" and "Faithfull: An Autobiography," Coco Pekelis Dalton is the author of "Everything I Know I Learned on Acid." The Daltons live in upstate New York.<br>A searing autobiography by one of rock 'n' roll's most tragic and romantic figures. A descendant of Austrian novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the beautiful Faithfull was discovered by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham in 1964 and became an instant pop celebrity with her recording of the brooding ``As Tears Go By,'' a song Oldham asked Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to write for her. In a short time, Faithfull had become an internationally famous music and movie star, but she had little control over her image or artistic output. With the aid of rock biographer Dalton (Mr. Mojo Risin': Jim Morrison, the Last Holy Fool, 1991, etc.), she describes her struggle against the passive ``Angel Doll'' persona foisted on her by the press and her relationship to the Stones, especially Jagger, for whom she left husband John Dunbar in 1966. A dark romanticism- -what she calls a ``Walter Pater aestheticism,'' replete with flashes of everything from astrology to black magic--pervades the narrative, which is chock-full of encounters with pop legends (John Lennon is ``amusingly cruel''; Allen Ginsberg ``has never been hip''). Faithfull, who's had her own share of same-sex dalliances, suggests it was sexual tensions among the highly repressed Stones that gave them their manic energy: ``Who was the great love of [Jagger's] life? Actually, I think it was Keith.'' The tone is both compelling and pathetic as Faithfull details two decades of drug abuse and numerous lonely attempts to escape her addiction. From watching a lover commit suicide to recent singing and acting successes on her own terms, Faithfull has lived enough for three or four people--yet she is only 47. Despite some trite prose (``Things were happening so fast and we were changing with them''), this holds greater interest than any other recent book about the Stones and their circle.

Written by the world's leading authority on Rasputin, this new biography draws on previously closed Soviet archives to offer new information on Rasputin's relationship with Empress Alexandra, sensational revelations about his sexual conquests, a re-examination of his murder, and more.</p><ul><li>Based on long-closed Soviet archives and the author's decades of research, encompassing sources ranging from baptismal records and forgotten police reports to notes written by Rasputin and personal letters</li><li>Reveals new information on Rasputin's family history and strange early life, religious beliefs, and multitudinous sexual adventures as well as his relationship with Empress Alexandra, ability to heal the haemophiliac tsarevich, and more</li><li>Includes many previously unpublished photos, including contemporary studio photographs of Rasputin and samples of his handwriting</li><li>Written by historian Joesph T. Fuhrmann, a Rasputin expert whose 1990 biography <i>Rasputin: A Life</i> was widely praised as the best on the subject </li></ul><p>Synthesizing archival sources with published documents, memoirs, and other studies of Rasputin into a single, comprehensive work, <i>Rasputin: The Untold Story </i>will correct a century's worth of misconception and error about the life and death of the famous Siberian mystic and healer and the decline and fall of Imperial Russia.</p></p><p><p>Legend portrays Rasputin as the "Mad Monk" who rampaged through St. Petersburg in an alcoholic haze, making love to scores of women. A symbol of excess and religious extremism, he was believed to hold a mysterious power, emanating from his hypnotic eyes, over Tsar Nicolas II and his family. The fact that he was neither mad nor a monk has not stopped scores of writers from repeating these and other bogus claims.</p><p>In <i>Rasputin: The Untold Story,</i> Rasputin scholar Joseph Fuhrmann shares the fruits of his two-decade search for the truth about Rasputin through previously closed Soviet archives. The man he discovers is entirely human and even more fascinating than the Svengali-like caricature imagined by millions.</p><p>This definitive biography unveils the truth behind Gregory Rasputin's storied life, controversial relationships, and much-discussed death. Fuhrmann unearths previously unknown details from Rasputin's childhood and his early years as a farmer and itinerant preacher to his decade-long relationship with the Romanovs.</p><p>This expos� features an account of the Church investigation into charges that Rasputin was a member of the heretical Khlysty, as well as the report from a new bishop that resolved the case in Rasputin's favor. It provides a new and accurate account of a deranged woman's attempt to murder Rasputin in the summer of 1914 and a pioneering exploration of Rasputin's and the Romanovs' surprising tolerance of homosexuals&#x2014;men who were out of the closet and forging public careers that would have been inconceivable anywhere else in the world at the time.</p><p>But what of Rasputin's mysterious powers? Was he a faith healer who actually stopped the hemophiliac tsarevich's bleeding at will? Could he hypnotize and control others with his eyes? Is it true that his murderers first poisoned, then shot, then beat him, before throwing him into an ice-choked river, where he finally drowned? Was British intelligence involved in the plot to murder Rasputin? Fuhrmann answers these questions and many more.</p><p>Whether or not he possessed superpowers, Rasputin was an undeniably powerful figure who played an important role in the Russian Empire's collapse. Fuhrmann portrays Rasputin's relationship with Nicholas and Alexandra through previously unpublished letters from the tsar and his wife to Rasputin and excerpts from Rasputin's personal notebooks.</p><p>Complete with many rare photos, including studio photographs of Rasputin, and samples of his handwriting, <i>Rasputin: The Untold Story</i> does more than set the record straight. It tells the powerful and tragic story of a man who started out with noble intentions and sincere convictions but fell victim to greed, lust, temptation, and his own power.</p><p><b>JOSEPH T. FUHRMANN, </b>Emeritus Professor of History at Murray State University in Kentucky, received his PhD from Indiana University, one of the leading centers for Russian studies. He attended Moscow University from 1965 to 1966. His first biography of Rasputin, <i>Rasputin: A Life</i>, was regarded as the best book on the subject. Since gaining access to previously closed Soviet archives, he has worked from 1991 in Russian repositories and studied a host of unpublished documents. The first biography inspired documentaries on A&amp;E and the History Channel. He has appeared in three programs as an interviewed guest and as script consultant for two of them.</p></p><h2>Eat Up: Food, Appetite and Eating What You Want</h2><p>Think about that first tickle of hunger in your stomach. A moment ago, you could have been thinking about anything, but now it's thickly buttered toast, a frosty scoop of ice cream straight from the tub, some creamy, cheesy scrambled eggs or a fuzzy, perfectly-ripe peach.<br><br>Eating is one of life's greatest pleasures. Food nourishes our bodies, helps us celebrate our successes (from a wedding cake to a post-night out kebab), cheers us up when we're down, introduces us to new cultures and - when we cook and eat together - connects us with the people we love.<br><br>In Eat Up, Ruby Tandoh celebrates the fun and pleasure of food, taking a look at everything from gluttons and gourmets in the movies, to the symbolism of food and sex. She will arm you against the fad diets, food crazes and bad science that can make eating guilt-laden and expensive, drawing eating inspiration from influences as diverse as Roald Dahl, Nora Ephron and more. Filled with straight-talking, sympathetic advice on everything from mental health to recipe ideas and shopping tips, this is a book that clears away the fog, to help you fall back in love with food.</p><p>Ruby Tandoh is an author and journalist who writes for, among others, the Guardian, Elle and Vice. A finalist on the 2013 Great British Bake Off, she has published two cookery books, Crumb and Flavour. She lives in Sheffield.&#34;I read it greedily.

She lay sparkling and oiled, warmed to a honey brown by the relentless sun. Later she would go down to the pool for a little while, just to cool off, but there were a dozen rituals she had to perform first. First she lay on her back every morning, her face creamed, her body oiled, the spectacular mane of blond hair shielded from the sun, her eyes covered with pads dipped in witch hazel, a damp washcloth framing her face so as not to leave the unseen scars of the year before unprotected in the sun. The breasts similarly protected by small, damp gauze pads for the same reasons. The three surgeries she had endured had served her well and didn't show. The first, at thirty-eight, later than she would have thought, just to smooth a small furrow from between her brows, and raise her eyelids to the exact location they had been ten years before. The second at forty-one, to enhance her breasts, and give them a fullness and upward tilt they had never really had, even at sixteen. And the last surgery a year before, a repeat of the first one, with only slightly more emphasis this time, and a few tucks above her ears. On a good day she looked thirty-five, a great one thirty-one, and in the camera's eye, she looked younger than that sometimes. . . sometimes. . . if the cameraman was any good. Sabina Quarles was forty-five years old. And her body was honed to perfection. She exercised every morning for an hour, was massaged three times a week, swam every afternoon, and walked two miles if it was cool enough. Not jogged, walked. She was no fool. She hadn't spent five thousand on her tits to shake them down another three inches jogging along the concrete of Beverly Hills.<br> <br> She was given to low-cut dresses that revealed the cleavage she was so proud of, the perfect expanse of honey-colored flesh that showed no signs of age. And she wore her skirts slit up high along her thigh as well. And with good reason. She had the kind of legs most women would have died for. Surgery hadn't given her those. God had. And He had endowed her well. In fact, he had been more than generous with Mary Elizabeth Ralston, born in Huntington, Pa., almost half a century before. Her father had been a miner, her mother a waitress at a truckstop lit with a blinking neon sign that flashed all night and was called "The Cafe." Her father had died when she was nine, her mother had married three more times in seven years, been widowed twice, and had died herself when Mary Elizabeth was seventeen. There was nothing left to hang around for, there hadn't been anyway. And Mary Elizabeth swung her long, shapely legs onto a Greyhound bus and headed for New York. Mary Elizabeth Ralston, for all intents and purposes, died that day. In New York she became Virginia Harlowe, a name she thought glamorous at the time, as she tried out for small modeling jobs and finally wound up in a chorus line in a show that was very much off Broadway. She thought it was the high point of her life, until at twenty-one, someone offered her a part in a movie. Her hair was jet black in those days. She carefully dyed it to hide the paler roots so it would set off her wide almond-shaped green eyes. She was not given a wardrobe for this movie but told to go to a freezing cold warehouse on the Lower East Side with two other girls and a man. It was a role she no longer ever thought of. Ever. Virginia Harlowe's life was even shorter than Mary Elizabeth Ralston's. There were a few more similar parts, a job in a strip joint on the West Side, and she was smart enough to know a dead end when she saw one. The name Sabina Quarles leapt at her from the pages of a magazine someone had left in the communal dressing room one night, and the money she had managed to save paid for a ticket to L.A. She was twenty-four and she knew it was almost too late. Almost, but not quite. She left the black hair dye in New York, and became a blonde when she hit California. Within three weeks, she found herself a rented room and an agent, and there was no mention of the film work she had done in New York. It was part of another life, a life she no longer chose to remember. Sabina Quarles, as she became and stayed after that, had a knack for forgetting whatever it was no longer convenient to remember, the life of the coal mines, the strip joint in New York, and the small budget ugly porn films she had made in the warehouse on the Lower East Side. In L.A., she became a model, and was cast in a few commercials, had a screen test at MGM and another at Fox, and in less than six months, she had landed a part in a very decent movie. There were three more small parts after that, and finally a decent role, and by twenty-six, Sabina's face was one that a number of directors knew and remembered. Her acting didn't set the world on fire, but she was good enough, and her agent found her a coach who helped her over the rough spots. He also helped her to get a few more parts. By twenty-eight, people knew her name and face, and her press agent saw to it that her name appeared regularly in the papers. She was linked with a number of male stars, and at thirty she had an affair with one of Hollywood's hottest stars. And she was more in demand after appearing with him in one of his movies. It was a career that had been hard earned, hard won, by the flesh on her back, her willingness to take off more clothes than some of her colleagues were at the time, and the fact that eventually she really did learn how to act. In her early thirties she disappeared for a while, and then reappeared with a bang in a hotly touted film everyone vowed would make her a star. It did not, but it etched her name in people's minds a little more firmly, and won her some better roles than the ones she'd had before.<br> <br> Sabina Quarles had worked hard to get where she was, and where she was at forty-five was no pinnacle of success, but her name was known in Hollywood, and with a moment's thought, she was known to moviegoers all over the country. . . Oh, I know. . . wasn't she in. . . a moment's blank stare and then a smile, a leer, a look of desire on men's faces. She was the kind of woman men had fantasies about going to bed with, although with age she became surprisingly selective. Sabina Quarles had staying power and a body that just wouldn't quit, no matter how old she was. She saw to that, to all of it, she kept up all her contacts, called her agent every day, worked hard when she got a part, and was surprisingly easy to work with.<br> <br> Sabina Quarles was not a prima donna, she was a movie star. . . more or less. . . one of those second-string bright lights who sometimes outlive the really big names who come and go and die every day in the studios of Hollywood, replaced by younger, fresher faces. Sabina Quarles's face was still well worth looking into, and her name didn't mean money in the box office, but it meant happy men when they left the theater. She still had the same quality she'd had at twenty-one. Men wanted to reach out and touch her. And she liked that, whether she chose to let them or not. That wasn't the point. Her body was her vehicle to success, and it always had been.<br> <br> With a glance at the alarm clock she kept on her terrace for exactly that purpose, she turned from her back to her stomach with a graceful flip, and with a familiar, reflexive flick of her wrist toward a large jar of cream, she creamed her face again and her arms. They were as young and firm as the rest of her. There was not a millimeter of droop or sag to Sabina.<br> <br> The phone rang just as she was about to get up anyway. It was almost time for two big glasses of mineral water, before she went downstairs to the pool for a swim. She glanced instinctively at her watch, wondering who it was. She had already called her agent.<br> <br> "Hello." Everything about Sabina Quarles was as smooth as honey. Her voice was deep and soft, a sexy voice that made men want to hold themselves as they sat staring at her in a darkened theater.<br> <br> "Sabina Quarles, please." A twenty-two-year-old secretarial voice chattered at the other end. The voice was unfamiliar to her.<br> <br> "This is she." She stood long and tall and beautiful in her living room, holding the phone, as she smoothed the blond mane off her shoulders with her other hand. No one would have guessed that the color was not entirely hers. Everything about Sabina was beautifully done, carefully thought out, and well maintained. She had spent a lifetime becoming who she was and she had done it well. It was only too bad that she hadn't gone further in her career. She wondered about it sometimes, but she hadn't given up. She was well known, if not the hottest item in town. But she never felt it was too late. There was nothing old or tired or middle-aged or defeated about Sabina. She was still a woman on her way up, even if she had hit a plateau in the last year or so. The lack of important parts was not something that fazed her, as long as the money kept coming in. She had done an ad featuring a sable coat only a month before. She was willing to do any number of things to keep her income flowing at a steady pace. . . as long as it wasn't TV. Television was something she would never stoop to.<br> <br> "This is Mel Wechsler's office," the voice said, full of self-importance. Melvin Wechsler was the biggest producer in Hollywood, and whoever worked for him shared in that limelight, or at least his secretary sounded as though she believed that. Sabina smiled. She had been out with him two or three times a few years before. Mel Wechsler, aside from everything else, was an attractive man. And she wondered why he was calling.<br> <br> "Yes?" There was laughter in the golden voice now, as she cast a glance around her living room. The apartment was modern, spare, on Linden Drive, in a slightly less than fabulous slice of Beverly Hills. But the address was good, and the apartment was furnished mostly in white, with two mirrored walls. She saw her naked image now, the breasts high and firm, just as she had paid for them to be, the legs still long and beautiful. She liked looking at herself, there was nothing in her image to worry or frighten her, and if something appeared she didn't like, she knew just how to have it taken care of.<br> <br> "Mrs. Wechsler was wondering if you could have lunch with him today. At the Bistro Gardens." She wondered why he hadn't called himself, and why it was on such short notice. Maybe it was for a part in a film, although he made fewer movies these days. In the last ten years, Melvin Wechsler's biggest hits had been on TV, although he did still make films. And he knew she didn't do TV. Everyone knew that about Sabina. Television was crap, and she said so every chance she got. She was Sabina Quarles, she didn't have to do TV. That was what she told her agent every time the subject came up, and it didn't come up very often anymore. He had better luck talking her into ads like the one with the sable coat. That had some class, as far as she was concerned, television did not. But Mel Wechsler did. And she had nothing to do for lunch. It was ten forty-five. "One o'clock?" It never occurred to the girl that Sabina would say no. No one ever did. Or damn few people anyway, and never actors.<br> <br> "One fifteen." Sabina looked amused. It was a game everyone played in Hollywood, and she was tougher than this girl and they both knew it.<br> <br> "That will be fine. The Bistro Gardens." She repeated as though Sabina would forget.<br> <br> "Thank you. Tell him I'll be there."<br> <br> You bet your ass you will, sweetheart, the girl thought to herself as she hung up, and buzzed through to Mrs. Wechsler. The secretary at the other end took the message that Sabina Quarles would meet him at one fifteen and Wechsler looked pleased when she handed him the note.<br> <br> At her end, Sabina looked pleased as well. Mel Wechsler. Now that she thought about it, she realized that she hadn't seen him in ages. He had even taken her to the Academy Awards ten years before. She always thought he'd been attracted to her more strenuously than he showed, but somehow they'd never gotten around to doing anything about it.<br> <br> She walked into her dressing room, a mirrored cubicle that led into a tiny bathroom, and stepped into the shower, flipping the knobs with practiced hands. The tingle of hot water felt good on her well-oiled flesh, and she washed her hair at the same time, wondering what she should wear for lunch with Melvin Wechsler. It all depended what he had in mind, a job, or something more personal. She wasn't quite sure which persona to be for him, hot star on the way up, or sultry woman of the world, and then she laughed. The two were one and the same. She was Sabina Quarles after all, long and lean and blond and beautiful. He could do a lot for her, in a number of ways, and she knew it.<br> <br> She ran the water ice cold over her flesh before she stepped out again, and her whole body tingled as she dried herself and then ran a comb through her long blond hair. If you didn't look too carefully, she decided, she could have been twenty-five. . . twenty-eight?. . . twenty-nine. . . she smiled. She didn't give a damn. Fourteen or ninety-eight suited her just fine. She was having lunch with Melvin Wechsler.<br> Excerpted from <i>Secrets</i> by Danielle Steel. Copyright (c) 1985 by Danielle Steel.

Rediscovered by fishermen a half-century later, the fish had grown to epic proportions. In <i>Chasing Rumor</i>, Cameron Chambers chronicles his modern-day pilgrimage to the rivers of Patagonia in pursuit of these legendary 20-pound trout. What started as a trip focused on catching fish became a love affair with the Patagonian landscape, environment, and, mostly, the people. From a business mogul turned B&amp;B owner to a kid determined to save a local trout population, <i>Chasing Rumor</i> is at times the story of a handful of fishermen, and at other times a tale of enormous trout.<br></p><p>A Modern-Day Pilgrimage to the Land of the Mythical Twenty-Pound Trout<br><br>When the North American rivers turn icy and the grass turns brown, fly fishermen retreat to the fishing holes of their imaginations. In the great tradition of fishing literature, Chasing Rumor is the chronicle of one young angler&#x2019;s attempt to experience the fishing utopia he had created in his mind&#x2019;s eye. As with all rumors and imaginings, in some ways his journey fell short of expectations. In others, the highlight reel he&#x2019;d created could not possibly prepare him for the adventures of this captivating and mysterious fisherman&#x2019;s mecca in a unique, pristine part of the world. <br><br>Cameron Chambers first experienced Patagonia while working as a fishing guide on Chile&#x2019;s Futaleaufu River.

With their largest and most famous chapter at the center of a bloody campaign in the Ku Klux Klan stronghold of Bogalusa, Louisiana, the Deacons became a popular symbol of the growing frustration with Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent strategy and a rallying point for a militant working-class movement in the South.<br><br>Lance Hill offers the first detailed history of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, who grew to several hundred members and twenty-one chapters in the Deep South and led some of the most successful local campaigns in the civil rights movement. In his analysis of this important yet long-overlooked organization, Hill challenges what he calls "the myth of nonviolence--the idea that a united civil rights movement achieved its goals through nonviolent direct action led by middle-class and religious leaders. In contrast, Hill constructs a compelling historical narrative of a working-class armed self-defense movement that defied the entrenched nonviolent leadership and played a crucial role in compelling the federal government to neutralize the Klan and uphold civil rights and liberties. <br><br><br><br></p><p>"An engrossing, well-written study."-- <i>Journal of American Studies</i> <br>Hill offers the first detailed history of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, a black self-defense organization particularly influential in Louisiana and Mississippi from 1964 to 1967. Frustrated with the policy of nonviolence espoused by Martin Luther King Jr., the Deacons sought a new form of armed resistance to constant threats of violence from whites.</p><h2>Top Cat</h2><p>Top Cat rules the house until an unexpected box arrives with someone new--and cute--inside.

That is, until a striped kitten arrives on the scene. Angry and jealous at first, the older cat hisses and bites, letting the new arrival know who's boss. But once the cat realizes the kitten is a permanent addition to the household, it makes the best of a difficult situation and becomes mentor to the fluffy newcomer. Lessons ensue: how to leave fur on the couch, chew on the houseplants, chase birds and "drink from the sink when company's there." With the knowing tone of a true cat lover, Ehlert's (Hands; Color Zoo) rhymed couplets accurately describe the common?often naughty?habits of house cats, and cat owners will nod in recognition at her scenarios. Visually, Ehlert creates a memorable cat duo in her trademark cut-paper collage style. Using pulpy, textured paper saturated with color, she assembles crisp shapes into forms exuding purr-sonality. On nearly every page she also includes sound effects, printed in small red letters, to accompany the cats' actions ("chomp," "swish," "scritch") and background noises (birdcalls, clanking silverware, etc.).

He regarded Lucy with a lot of interest infused with a dash of cool disapproval. She found the combination both annoying and unnerving. But the real problem was that Mason looked even better now than he had thirteen years ago when he had figured so powerfully in her fevered teenage imagination. Her first reaction upon walking through the door of Fletcher Hardware had been primal and flat-out breath�taking. I&#x2019;ve been looking for you. The wolf-sized dog that padded out from behind the counter to inspect her regarded her with an expression remarkably similar to Ma�son&#x2019;s. The animal wasn&#x2019;t just the size of a wolf&#x2014;it looked like one, as well. An aging wolf, she concluded. There was some gray around the muzzle. The beast&#x2019;s eyes were not the standard dark brown associated with most breeds. Instead, they were a disconcerting shade of hazel gold that was a little too close to the color of Mason&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Joe,&#x201d; Mason said, nodding toward the dog. She looked down at Joe and held out her hand. &#x201c;Hello, Joe.&#x201d; </p><p>Joe stared at her for a moment longer, his gaze unflinching. Evi�dently concluding that she was neither a threat nor prey, he sniffed her fingers. Satisfied, he sat back. Gingerly, she scratched him behind his ears. Joe chuffed a bit and licked her hand. </p><p>&#x201c;He likes you,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;Mostly he ignores people.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m thrilled, of course, that he doesn&#x2019;t intend to rip out my throat,&#x201d; Lucy said. </p><p>&#x201c;He hasn&#x2019;t gone for anyone&#x2019;s throat for at least a week.&#x201d; Mason tossed the gleaming wrench into the air and caught it with a barely noticeable twist of his wrist, making it look easy. &#x201c;Heard you were in town to clean out your aunt&#x2019;s place and put it on the market.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the plan.&#x201d; She stopped rubbing Joe&#x2019;s ears and straightened. </p><p>She was determined to remain as cool as Mason. It wasn&#x2019;t easy. She was still struggling to get past the shock of coming face-to-face with him. She had expected to see his uncle behind the counter when she walked into the hardware store. </p><p>The possibility that she might run into Mason while she was in Summer River had occurred to her, but she had dismissed it as ex�tremely remote. According to the last update from Sara some six months ago, Mason was in Washington, D.C., where he and his brother ran a very expensive, very low-profile, very sophisticated pri�vate security consulting business. </p><p>&#x201c;How long will you be around?&#x201d; Mason asked. </p><p>She smiled. She couldn&#x2019;t help it. She made a show of glancing at her watch. &#x201c;Less than three minutes into this conversation and already it sounds like an interrogation. In hindsight I may have made a mistake when I advised you to go into law enforcement all those years ago.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You made the suggestion. I&#x2019;m the one who made the decision.&#x201d; </p><p>What in the world was that supposed to mean? she wondered. Sud�denly she got that faint, tiny little inner ping of knowing, the same sensation she experienced when she was closing in on a missing heir. Something bad had happened to Mason Fletcher. She would have bet good money that it was linked to his career path. And, being Mason Fletcher, he was taking full responsibility for the decision that had sent him down that road. Mason hadn&#x2019;t changed, she thought. He was the kind of man who would always take full responsibility&#x2014;even for stuff that, technically speaking, wasn&#x2019;t his responsibility. </p><p>She sought a neutral topic of conversation. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad to see that the hardware store survived,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;When did your uncle buy it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A few months after he retired.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the last store on the block that was here when I used to visit Aunt Sara. This town has really changed.&#x201d; </p><p>Most of the old, traditional stores on Main Street had been replaced with upscale shops and trendy eateries. Fletcher Hardware&#x2014;bordered on one side by a wine shop and on the other side by an art gallery&#x2014; was a stubborn anachronism. </p><p>Mason surprised her with a wry smile. &#x201c;Welcome to the new, im�proved wine-country boutique town of Summer River. But in case you&#x2019;re wondering, the old Summer River is still here, just beneath the surface.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Meaning?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Meaning it&#x2019;s still a small town. News travels fast.&#x201d; </p><p>Lucy nodded. &#x201c;Which is how you knew that I was here.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A lot of people know you&#x2019;re here, Lucy,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>She raised her brows in polite inquiry. &#x201c;Is that a warning?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Maybe. The fact that you are Sara&#x2019;s sole heir has stirred up some deep waters.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I know.&#x201d; </p><p>She had been ignoring phone calls from lawyers and realtors for more than a month while she considered how to deal with her in�heritance. </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I asked you how long you plan to stay,&#x201d; Mason said. </p><p>&#x201c;The answer to your question is that I don&#x2019;t know how long I&#x2019;ll be in town.&#x201d; She was determined not to let him intimidate her. &#x201c;A couple of weeks, I think. I need to make arrangements to pack and move my aunt&#x2019;s belongings, and then I have to get the house ready to put on the market.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The place should sell fast,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a real nice little ex�ample of the Craftsman style, and one thing that has come out of Summer River going upscale is that property values have skyrocketed. Folks looking for a weekend house in wine country love that kind of architecture. But the real value is in the property.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The old orchard?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s prime vineyard land. Worth a bundle in this market. Every new Silicon Valley billionaire wants to open his very own winery and put his name on a label. It&#x2019;s a major status symbol.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I noticed that most of the orchards and farms are gone.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been disappearing for years. I&#x2019;m surprised you didn&#x2019;t know that. But then, you never came back to visit Sara after you left thirteen years ago, did you?&#x201d; </p><p>The comment, freighted as it was with stern disapproval, hit her like a bucket of cold water. Anger flashed through her. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay, that answers one question,&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I knew the town had changed, but when I walked in here I won�dered if you had changed. Clearly the answer is no. You are still in the habit of jumping to conclusions, assuming the worst and giving lectures.&#x201d; </p><p>He thought about that for a moment and then inclined his head half an inch. &#x201c;You know what? You&#x2019;re right. Maybe I did jump to con�clusions. So why didn&#x2019;t you come to visit your aunt for the past thir�teen years?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What makes you so sure I haven&#x2019;t been back here?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Deke mentioned that you never returned.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Your uncle implied that I ignored my aunt all these years?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He just commented that you hadn&#x2019;t come back, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Once again Mason tossed the steel wrench casually into the air and caught it with fluid ease. &#x201c;He said you never returned after that summer when I pissed you off by yanking you out of the party at Harper Ranch Park.&#x201d; </p><p>That stopped her. &#x201c;The old Harper Ranch is now a park?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The town took it over a couple of years ago. Grass, picnic tables, a ball field, playground, dog-walking areas, the works. You wouldn&#x2019;t recognize the place.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I see. Well, as it happens, your uncle is right. This is the first time I&#x2019;ve returned to Summer River since that night.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p><p>She gave him a serene go-to-hell smile. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really none of your busi�ness, is it?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nope, just curious.&#x201d; </p><p>Thirteen years ago everyone said you didn&#x2019;t want to mess with Mason Fletcher. Nothing had changed except that he was now the man she had known that he would become and then some. It was as if he had been tempered in fire like the steel blade of some ancient sword. Everything about him had gotten harder, stronger, more re�lentless. The sharp planes and angles of his face had become fierce. Time had added some sleek, solid muscle and endowed him with the confident air of a man who knows what he wants, what he will toler�ate and where he draws the line. </p><p>The years had given him something else as well&#x2014;the rare, invisible aura of quiet, inner power that was the hallmark of a man in full con�trol of himself. </p><p>He did, however, look considerably the worse for wear around the edges. She had a feeling he&#x2019;d learned the hard way what every profes�sional guardian angel probably had to learn&#x2014;that you couldn&#x2019;t save everyone. For a man as determined and unyielding as Mason, that would have been one very tough lesson. </p><p>In spite of her irritation, she felt herself softening. It was hard to stay mad at a man who was born to do the right thing when the chips were down. He really couldn&#x2019;t help it, she thought. He was what he was, and there was probably no force on the face of the planet that could change that. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for Pete&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Just to clarify, Aunt Sara did not want me to come back here after that last summer. In fact, she didn&#x2019;t want anyone in the family to visit her in Summer River. We respected her wishes. And while I certainly don&#x2019;t owe you any explanations, I can assure you that I saw a lot of her. She and Mary stayed with me several times each year. Sara knew that I find the holidays stressful, so she made sure to spend them with me. After she and Mary sold the antiques shop, I joined them on some of their cruises. I can assure you that Sara was not neglected in any way.&#x201d; Lucy took a breath. &#x201c;I loved her. And I loved Mary, too, because she loved Sara and Sara loved her. There. Satisfied?&#x201d; </p><p>Mason had the grace to look apologetic. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to imply you had neglected your aunt.&#x201d; </p><p>She gave him her best fake bright smile. &#x201c;Of course you did.&#x201d; </p><p>His jaw hardened. &#x201c;I understand that family dynamics can be com�plicated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No kidding. Especially when viewed from the outside.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason exhaled slowly. &#x201c;Okay, you&#x2019;ve made your point. I liked Sara. Mary, too. I was sorry to hear that they had been killed.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Lucy said. She hesitated, wondering if it was too soon to probe for answers. </p><p>&#x201c;I suppose you heard it was a car accident?&#x201d; she said. </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. It&#x2019;s always a shock. Aaron and I lost our parents in a car accident.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long time,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean it didn&#x2019;t happen and that it didn&#x2019;t leave some major wounds. You heal from wounds, if you&#x2019;re lucky, but there are always scars.&#x201d; </p><p>He looked as if the simple observation had caught him off guard. She got the feeling he was unsure how to respond. </p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he agreed finally. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t mean there aren&#x2019;t scars.&#x201d; </p><p>She tightened her grip on the straps of the black tote she had slung over her shoulder. &#x201c;Were you here in town when my aunt and Mary . . . ?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;No, I arrived a couple of weeks ago. I&#x2019;m taking some time off from work.&#x201d; He eyed her with sudden, sharp curiosity. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. Just wondered.&#x201d; She felt a little deflated. If Mason had been in town at the time of the accident, he probably would have asked any questions that needed to be asked. He had been a cop, after all. But he had not been in Summer River when Sara and Mary died. He didn&#x2019;t know any more than she did. &#x201c;Sara told me that you and your brother run a security consulting firm back in D.C.&#x201d; </p><p>He looked first surprised and then amused. &#x201c;Sara kept you in�formed of my whereabouts?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I gather that from time to time your uncle told her what was going on with you and your brother.&#x201d; Lucy smiled. &#x201c;Sara said he is very proud of both of you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Deke and I always knew that Aaron would do something to change the world,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;He wound up with degrees in math and computer science.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Impressive. What, exactly, do you and Aaron do as consultants?&#x201d; </p><p>He gave her what was no doubt meant to be a charming consul�tant&#x2019;s smile. &#x201c;We consult.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I get that. And for the record, the I&#x2019;m-a-consultant-and-I&#x2019;m�here-to-help smile needs an upgrade.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason stopped smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll work on it.&#x201d; </p><p>I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Who do you consult for?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We specialize in closing cold cases. Our clients are mostly small-town police departments that lack the expertise, the technology and the manpower to handle major crimes that have gone stone cold.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Do you go out into the field to investigate?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sometimes. But our primary asset is a proprietary computer pro�gram we named Alice. Aaron created it to help identify patterns in an old case. If we can find a pattern, we&#x2019;ve got a shot at helping the cops track down the perps.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sounds exciting.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a cop anymore, I&#x2019;m a consultant,&#x201d; he said coolly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see much action.&#x201d; </p><p>He probably wasn&#x2019;t lying, she decided. But he wasn&#x2019;t telling her the whole truth, either. </p><p>&#x201c;What can I do for you today?&#x201d; Mason continued. &#x201c;I assume you came in here to pick up some of the things you need to get your aunt&#x2019;s house ready for the market?&#x201d; </p><p>Whoa. Talk about hitting a stone wall, Lucy thought. Mason wanted to change the topic of conversation. </p><p>&#x201c;Actually, I stopped in to get some advice about local contractors from your uncle. I wasn&#x2019;t sure who else to ask. I know Sara trusted Deke when it came to that sort of thing.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I can ask him for some names when he gets back. What kind of work are you thinking of doing?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The big-ticket item is the kitchen. It&#x2019;s badly outdated. Dad says that bringing it up to date will add a few thousand to the value of the house.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;Is your dad still a professor?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes. He&#x2019;s head of the sociology department at the college where he teaches.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;And your mother?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still teaching psychology.&#x201d; </p><p>Mason put the wrench down on the counter. &#x201c;Both your folks re�married, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, making the word very crisp. &#x201c;About that contractor. I&#x2019;ve got a limited budget.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Mason reached for a pad of paper. He pulled it close and picked up a pen. &#x201c;Okay, you want someone who can update the kitchen without spending a fortune. Anything else? </p><p>&#x201c;The outside needs painting.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s another major job.&#x201d; Mason wrote a note on the pad of paper and then looked up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting to talk big bucks here. I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s worth it, to tell you the truth.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;But everyone says those are the sorts of upgrades that add value to the house.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true, but around here, it&#x2019;s the land itself that has the real value. Still, those old Craftsman houses go for a nice chunk of change, and there are always people looking for weekend places. I&#x2019;m just sug�gesting that you don&#x2019;t pour a lot of cash into upgrades.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;There is one project I&#x2019;d like to do inside that I think will make a big cosmetic difference in the living room.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I want to restore the fireplace to its original condition. It really was beautiful.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I remember it,&#x201d; Mason said. &#x201c;There was a lot of nice stonework around it. You don&#x2019;t see good craftsmanship like that anymore.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately, Aunt Sara covered the entire front of the fireplace with tile.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Huh. Wonder why?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. She never mentioned it, so when I walked into the house yesterday I was surprised to see what she had done.

The fatalist automatically resigns himself to whatever befalls him, seeing in effects no cause attributable to his own action--or inaction; but resigned always to the working of an inexorable fate. <br><br>The Christian counterpart tends to accept his lot as the working of God's Will in which he has no say or part. <br>At the other extreme stands the rebellious independent, determined to exercise his right to free, self-willed action. <br><br>This book, as one of its many values, shows the extent to which Hierarchy and other centres of life on the planet are dependent upon the unpredictable and often irresponsible factor of human free will. During the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II, every opportunity and every possible spiritual stimulation was offered to humanity in an effort to avoid precipitation of conflict on to the physical plane. Disciples and aspirants to discipleship were asked to give special cooperation to the Hierarchy, and to make an all-out effort to provide adequate leadership to human thought and decision. All were left free, however, to determine their own limits, if any, and to decide their own actions. According to law, the Hierarchy--even at danger point--could not infringe human free will and dictate or impose a course of action based on their own deeper knowledge and more profound insight. <br><br>Many of the spiritual factors surrounding the period of human history from 1919 to 1949 are presented in this book. The energies at work behind the world scene are shown; and the identity revealed of certain great Beings magnetically attracted in service towards this planet at a climaxing moment in the evolution of our planetary life. <br><br>These factors are an aid to our understanding of the interrelated energy patterns within the universe which operate according to law. But essentially they provide the esotericist with knowledge of available energy flow responding to planetary purpose and plan which can be contacted and given conscious and intelligent cooperation, particularly by those in whom the selfish, self-centred will has been transcended so that the spiritual will can be given more adequate expression. Some of these energy factors are particularly clear in the special "Messages" given over a period of many years at the time of the Festivals of Easter, Wesak and the Christ. <br><br>Many aspects of Hierarchical work, thought and planning are discussed in these Messages, with the Hierarchical effect shown of planetary evolution and initiation and its reflection into humanity. This achieved a climax at the time of the three Festivals in 1945, when a momentous decision was taken involving, among other results, the eventual externalisation of the Hierarchy arid the reappearance of the Christ. <br><br>The final section of the book discusses the "Stages in the Externalisation of the Hierarchy". It is often difficult for the human mind to imagine the problems facing those liberated from the restrictions of form. It is even more difficult to contemplate the effects in those so liberated of a free choice to reassume such a limitation. <br><br>So we are helped to understand what the interdependence of life on this planet really signifies in terms of love, sacrifice and service by the part to the needs of the whole.</p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master,and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching for the present and the immediate future.</p><h2>H2O</h2><p>This volume takes us on a gloriously offbeat and intelligent investigation into exactly what we do and do not know about water, the substance which sustains life.</p><p>Philip Ball is Associate Editor for the Physical Sciences with Nature.

Still, many people don't know where to start, what to say, or how to say it. <i>The Complete Evangelism Guidebook</i> is a comprehensive resource on everything a person needs to know about sharing his or her faith. <br>Well-known evangelists such as Rick Warren, Josh McDowell, and Luis Palau combine their knowledge into one comprehensive and easy-to-read handbook.

With more than seventy articles written by nearly sixty evangelism experts, <i>The Complete Evangelism Guidebook</i> will make sharing the faith easier than ever!</p><p>Sharing your faith doesn't have to be difficult!<br><br>The biblical model for personal evangelism was relatively simple for Jesus's followers. They followed their Lord and shared their faith with whomever they met. So what makes us reluctant to do the same? Do we lack confidence or fear rejection? Perhaps we don't feel qualified. But it doesn't have to be that way, says Scott Dawson.

This project is the culmination of compiling the contributions of over 60 authors form all walks of life who share one passion--evangelism. You will notice professor, pastors, and lay people all writing about how you can be involved in evangelism. To us, it is not about if you are involved, but how you are involved!

Found throughout history and in nearly every culture and religion, amulets and talismans can be made and used by anyone.</p> <p>Spanning the world through the diverse cultures of Sumeria, Babylonia, Greece, Italy, India, Western Europe, and North America, this book presents the history and uses of amulets and talismans. Readers will also learn the magical properties of hundreds of symbols and objects commonly used as amulets, as well as how to create, empower, and use their own talismans for health and wellness in mind, body, and spirit.</p></p><p>If you have ever tried to learn about amulets and talismans, you probably came across some of the same problems I did. Most authorities either describe the historical talismans or tell you how to invent your own. I always thought it would be great if a book looked at everything and was truly comprehensive. That's why I'm glad Llewellyn has published <i>The Complete Book of Amulets &amp; Talismans</i> by Migene Gonz�les-Wippler. <br> <br>If you are interested in learning how to do real magic, this book is a resource you must have. Virtually every magical tradition uses amulets and talismans. Witches use them. Ceremonial magicians use them. Wiccans use them. Chaos magicians use them. Folk magicians use them. You should use them, too, and this book shows you exactly how to do that. <br> <br>Do you need a talisman for health? How about one to obtain eloquence? Or perhaps you'd like one for honors, riches and prosperity? Instructions are here for the way to make and charge them. You'll learn how to incorporate astrology, Kabbalah, numerology, color, and much more into the making and charging of some of the most effective magical devices you've ever worked with. <br> <br>But some of you reading this may not want to use amulets and talismans so much as learn about them and their history. No such anthropological and religious study can be complete without reference to this book. It not only gives information about the types of amulets and talismans used in contemporary and ancient cultures, but it also describes how they were used and the sources of the beliefs associated with them. <br> <br>This book has it all &#x2014; history and research, design and technique. This book is far more than just "complete." Perhaps we should have called it "ultimate." But whatever it's called, if you are interested in the history of talismans and amulets, or if you want to actively make and use your own, you must get this book. <br> <br>Migene Gonzalez-Wippler was born in Puerto Rico and has degrees in psychology and anthropology from the University of Puerto Rico and from Colombia University. &nbsp;She has worked as a science editor for the &nbsp;Interscience Division of John Wiley, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Museum of Natural History, and as an English editor for the United Nations in Vienna, where she lived for many years. &nbsp;She is a cultural anthropologist and lectures frequently at universities and other educational institutions. <br></p><h2>Island of Legends (4) (The Unwanteds)</h2><p>Uncover adventure and dangerous secrets in book four of the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling Unwanteds series, which <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>called &#x201c;<i>The Hunger Games </i>meets Harry Potter.&#x201d;<br><br>When hundreds of lights appear across the sea during Artim�&#x2019;s first annual masquerade ball, the party is over.

It was dark as pitch. A moment before, he&#x2019;d been running through the chaos in Artim�, wrists shackled in front of him. He&#x2019;d stumbled up the marble staircase of the mansion and flown down the last hallway on the left, all the way to the end of it, and taken a sharp right turn into the kitchenette, which is where he&#x2019;d arrived from in the first place. He&#x2019;d stepped into the glass tube that had brought him here, and looked at all the buttons as the voices behind him grew louder. The tube in Haluki&#x2019;s office closet had only one button, but this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As the panic rose to his throat, Aaron raised his hands and pressed down, hitting all the buttons at once. Instantly the light disappeared.<br> <br>Had he gone back to Haluki&#x2019;s house? Perhaps one of the closet&#x2019;s double doors had swung shut. Aaron raised his arms in front of him, finding the opening in the tube so he could exit. He reached his shackled hands through it and felt nothing but air. No closet doors. Nothing solid at all.<br> <br>He gingerly stepped one foot outside the tube. The surface below was uneven, not floorlike at all. In fact, it felt like dirt, but not well-packed dirt like a road in Quill. The earth beneath him had not been heavily trod upon for quite some time. Perhaps never. Well, it couldn&#x2019;t be never, Aaron reasoned. Someone had to have put the tube here.<br> <br>He sniffed and hung on to the side of the tube&#x2019;s opening. He could smell dampness in the air, like Quill an hour after a rare downpour, only this was somehow richer. Earthier. The scent of mint was in the air as well, and he could hear something trickling, a brook or a stream not far away. It seemed like it could be pleasant here, but it was different and unexpected, and therefore quite frightening to someone from Quill.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is this place?&#x201d; Aaron whispered, straining to see something. Anything. His fingers trembled, and he gripped the edge of the tube opening even harder. He turned his head to look back inside the tube, but if there were any buttons, they weren&#x2019;t visible in the darkness.<br> <br>Eventually his eyes adjusted enough that he could just barely make out a few shapes. Large tree shapes loomed overhead, and the outline of an enormous rock appeared to step out of the shadows. Near the rock he could see a faint patch of light from the moon shining through the trees.<br> <br>After another moment of calm, Aaron felt a bit of courage returning. It was enough for them to venture one step toward the light, and then another. A stick cracked under his foot and he froze, but nothing came of it. He glanced over his shoulder, making sure he could still see the tube, and then continued toward the light.<br> <br>When he stood in the middle of the glow, he looked up through the clearing. Jungle vines hung all around from the most monstrous trees he&#x2019;d ever seen. The rock nearby was much larger than he&#x2019;d thought. It jutted upward into the darkness, and Aaron couldn&#x2019;t tell how high or deep it went.<br> <br>Aaron peered at the rock. Perhaps he could slam his shackles against it to break free. He edged closer, eyeing the shadowy crevasses, one of which looked like it could be the entrance to a cave. Tentatively he tapped the clay shackles on the rock.<br> <br>Immediately two craggy yellow eyes opened and stared back at him. The cave opening changed shape, as if it were the giant rock&#x2019;s mouth, but it didn&#x2019;t speak. Aaron backed away in fright. And then, from behind him, a high-pitched noise like a woman&#x2019;s scream pierced his ears.<br> <br>Aaron whirled around and screamed too. The screech grew louder, turning the boy&#x2019;s knees to liquid. He could make out a large animal shape creeping toward him. Aaron tried to run but stumbled over his feet, unable to get his legs to move properly, and then pitched forward as his foot tangled with a vine on the jungle floor. He braced his fall with his forearms and rolled onto his back, desperate to see if either the yellow-eyed rock or the screaming monster was following him.<br> <br>One of them was. The screaming creature crouched nearby, its hindquarters shifting as if it were about to pounce.<br> <br>Aaron rolled again, onto his front side, and scrambled up to his feet, inching sideways toward the tube and holding his only weapon&#x2014;his shackled wrists&#x2014;in front of him. He scooted faster now in the direction of the tube, praying not to trip, as the monster leaped and landed on the ground in the patch of light where Aaron had been.<br> <br>The creature gleamed black all over, shining brighter along the curve of its back. Its face resembled that of the frightening winged statue who guarded Aaron&#x2019;s twin brother, Alex, and the mansion in Artim�, and its body was nearly as large. But this creature had no wings. It crept toward Aaron and screamed once more, displaying four gleaming, dripping fangs.<br> <br>Aaron froze, nearly fainting with fear, paralyzed by the hideous screaming as if he were under a spell. The creature pounced, knocking Aaron to the ground and holding him there with a giant paw on his chest.<br> <br>It was so startling, so uncommon, that instead of frightening Aaron, it infuriated him. He was the high priest of Quill, after all. He demanded respect. Aaron forgot his fear and sprang into action, slamming his shackles hard into the nose of the creature and crying out with all his might, &#x201c;Get off, beast! Release me!&#x201d;<br> <br>To Aaron&#x2019;s astonishment, the creature stepped back. After the slightest hesitation, Aaron rolled out of reach and crawled to the tube, his hands flailing wildly for buttons&#x2014;any buttons he could find. Anything to get him out of here.<br> <br>As his right hand connected and the dark jungle disappeared, Aaron realized his shackles had fallen away. His hands were free.</p><h2>Passionate Parenting: Enjoying the Journey of Parenting Teens</h2><p><i>Passionate Parenting</i> is about pursuing the heart of your teenager and helping that heart fall in love with the heart of God.

She then moved to her commercial stovetop and gave the marshmallow creme simmering in the saucepan a gentle stir. Satisfied, she turned the burner off and set the saucepan in a stainless steel bowl filled with ice. When the marshmallow creme was sufficiently cooled, Ella Mae reached for the liqueur bottles on the worktable and poured small amounts of cr�me de menthe and white cr�me de cacao into the fluffy mixture. Next, she squeezed in four drops of green food coloring and watched the white and green spiral around the tip of her wooden spoon before the green finally overpowered the white. She continued to stir until all traces of white were gone.</p><p>&#x201c;Green as an Irish meadow,&#x201d; she declared to the empty room.</p><p>Ella Mae&#x2019;s mind began to wander. She thought of all the things she needed to accomplish that day and of the endless list of tasks still awaiting her. She glanced down at the saucepan again and frowned. She couldn&#x2019;t remember if she&#x2019;d added the cr�me de menthe.</p><p>Shrugging, she grabbed the glass liqueur bottle and added a generous splash to the mixture. After giving it a good stir, she leaned over the pan and inhaled deeply.</p><p>&#x201c;Minty fresh,&#x201d; she murmured to herself and wiped at a drip running down the liqueur bottle with the hem of her apron.</p><p>Feeling pleased with her morning&#x2019;s work so far, Ella Mae hummed as she entered the walk-in freezer to fetch her beater attachment and a large mixing bowl. The cold air permeated the warm cocoon of marshmallow and mint that enveloped the entire kitchen and Ella Mae shivered. She didn&#x2019;t want to feel. She didn&#x2019;t want to think. She just wanted to bake, cook, and plate and repeat those steps over and over until it was time to close The Charmed Pie Shoppe for the day. After that, she could collect Chewy, her Jack Russell terrier, from doggie daycare and go home. HGTV and The Food Network awaited her there. As did her cooking magazines and page after page of glossy photographs and new recipes.</p><p>The oven timer beeped and Ella Mae backed out of the freezer, dropped the cold beaters and bowl on the counter, and pulled on a pair of oven mitts. She transferred six shepherd&#x2019;s pies, a trio of potato and green onion pies, and a dozen corned beef hand pies to the cooking racks. The scent of hot, buttery crust and fresh spices settled on her shoulders like a shawl, but she didn&#x2019;t pause to savor the aromas.</p><p>Instead, she poured heavy cream into the chilled bowl, attached the beater to her commercial mixer, and switched on the appliance. She stared at the white liquid as it frothed and churned in the bowl while her right hand involuntarily slid into her apron pocket and touched the letter nestled inside.</p><p>&#x201c;No! I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said, withdrawing her hand with the swiftness of someone whose fingers have come too close to a fire. &#x201c;I have a business to run. I&#x2019;m on the Council of Elders. Everyone&#x2019;s looking to me for answers. I need to stay focused.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae&#x2019;s stomach growled and she removed one of the steaming shepherd&#x2019;s pies from the cooling rack and cut herself a thick wedge. While the mixer whirred, she savored every bite of pie. She had so little time to sit and enjoy a meal these days that she decided to take a few, precious minutes to enjoy this one. When her pie was done, she raised her coffee cup to her mouth and drained the tepid liquid. She then reached out to set the cup on the table, but her eyes had strayed to the window above the kitchen sink and she missed. The cup fell, and when it struck the kitchen floor and smashed into pieces, Ella Mae shouted, &#x201c;<i>Opa!</i>&#x201d; She&#x2019;d survived so much over the past two years and wasn&#x2019;t about to let a broken cup bother her.</p><p>Turning her attention back to the whipped cream, she cursed. She switched off the mixer, dipped the beater in the cream, and raised it again. In lieu of stiff peaks, the mixture was grainy. For the first time in her life, Ella Mae had overbeaten the cream.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just add a little sugar,&#x201d; she said, heading for the dry-goods shelf. Grabbing the sugar container, she pried off the lid and scooped out a heaping tablespoonful. &#x201c;A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,&#x201d; she sang and dumped the sugar into the cream. She turned on the mixer again and finally achieved the desired result. At last, she folded the rescued whipped cream into the green marshmallow mixture and then poured the whole thing over the chocolate-cookie-crumb crust.</p><p>She carried the pie to the freezer and placed it at the end of a row of a dozen green pies. &#x201c;That should be plenty for takeout orders and afternoon tea. I hope I made enough four-leaf clover cookies.&#x201d;</p><p>Back at the worktable, she saw that Reba or Jenny had left her an order ticket and had also dumped a pile of dirty dishes in the sink. The lunch rush was over, but there were still customers in the dining room. The Charmed Pie Shoppe had become so popular with locals and tourists alike that people often had to wait until two o&#x2019;clock for a table. And since afternoon tea service started at three, Ella Mae baked and plated for hours in a row. She rarely left the kitchen, taking brief coffee or meal breaks perched on a stool next to the dishwasher. From this vantage point, she could stare out across the small rear parking area and over the Dumpster to the block beyond. On a clear day, she could see the roof of the fire station, its shingled gray gable rising a few feet above the brick building housing Havenwood Insurance. At certain times, the sun would hit the fire station&#x2019;s Dalmatian weathervane just right and it would wink like a star. Ella Mae would gaze at the glowing copper and think of Hugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Hugh&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; she told herself, and read the order ticket once more.</p><p>She plated a generous wedge of shepherd&#x2019;s pie with a side of field greens and was just spooning charred corn salad into a bowl to go along with a serving of corned beef hand pie when she heard the blare of a car alarm.</p><p>Ella Mae didn&#x2019;t pay much attention to the wailing until a second alarm sounded. And then a third. The noise was fairly loud and Ella Mae guessed that the cars were parked nearby. She barely had time to register this thought before voices raised in angry shouts added to the cacophony. Ella Mae couldn&#x2019;t tell what had made the people so upset, but she knew either Reba or Jenny would inform her sooner or later.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t have to wait long.</p><p>Reba burst through the swing doors and cried, &#x201c;Do you hear that devil&#x2019;s racket outside?&#x201d; She put her hands on her hips and surveyed Ella Mae. &#x201c;Mr. Jenkins just drove on the wrong side of the street. He scraped four parked cars from bumper to bumper, takin&#x2019; off their side mirrors as he passed, and then plowed through the Longwoods&#x2019; picket fence, flattenin&#x2019; their collection of garden gnomes as he went. Mrs. Longwood is fit to be tied.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae glanced toward the window. &#x201c;Oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all you have to say?&#x201d; Reba pulled a red licorice stick from her apron pocket and shook it at Ella Mae. &#x201c;What did you put in that Leprechaun Pie? Mr. Jenkins had two pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae feigned great interest in the parsley on the cutting board. &#x201c;Are you asking if I enchanted our Saint Patrick&#x2019;s Day dessert?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know damn well I am!&#x201d; Reba snapped. &#x201c;Seein&#x2019; as you transfer your emotions into the food you make, I&#x2019;d like to know what you <i>put</i> in those pies.&#x201d;</p><p>Shaking her head, Ella Mae said, &#x201c;Nothing. I&#x2019;ve been deliberately trying not to use magic when I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Down in the dumps?&#x201d; Reba narrowed her eyes and bit into her licorice stick. &#x201c;Or just plain drunk?&#x201d; In a flash, she closed the space between herself and Ella Mae just in time to catch Ella Mae&#x2019;s next exhalation. &#x201c;You smell like a Peppermint Pattie dipped in paint thinner. How much of that mint liqueur have you had?&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae felt her cheeks grow warm. She walked to the sink, turned the faucet on, and held a dirty dish under the water. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a drop. I wiped the bottle with my apron, which is why I smell like I do.&#x201d;</p><p>Reba grabbed the plate and loaded it into the dishwasher. &#x201c;I hope so. You&#x2019;ve always been a glass of vino after work kind of girl.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I still am. Though sometimes I have two, but that started when Hugh left,&#x201d; Ella Mae said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you miss him, but it&#x2019;s not like you two broke up. He told you he needed to travel&#x2014;to search for a way to reclaim his lost powers&#x2014;and you said you understood. It&#x2019;s only been a month and he&#x2019;s sent you letters. I see you readin&#x2019; and rereadin&#x2019; them.&#x201d; Reba frowned. &#x201c;Is that why you put too much booze into your pies? I&#x2019;m assumin&#x2019; that&#x2019;s what happened because you&#x2019;ve been real distracted lately.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was a mistake, and I only made it with a few pies. Not all of them. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d added that much more. I guess my magic somehow amplified the effects,&#x201d; Ella Mae said and continued to wash dishes. The steam from the water rose in diaphanous plumes around her face, masking her anguished expression.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to deliver those orders and then I&#x2019;m coming back here to pinch you,&#x201d; Reba warned.</p><p>&#x201c;You already pinched me for luck today. And guess what? It didn&#x2019;t work.&#x201d;</p><p>Reba left with the food. When she returned, she turned off the faucet and took Ella Mae&#x2019;s red, water-wrinkled hands in her own. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s got you so sad?&#x201d;</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Ella Mae withdrew Hugh&#x2019;s letter and placed it in Reba&#x2019;s palm. Reba had just unfolded it when Jenny Upton, The Charmed Pie Shoppe&#x2019;s newest waitress, entered the kitchen.</p><p>&#x201c;Where are those chocolate coins?&#x201d; She frantically scanned the room, her gaze passing right over Ella Mae and Reba. &#x201c;The ones wrapped in gold foil. I need them and I need them now.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae heard the note of desperation in Jenny&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;I thought we made plenty of Saint Patty&#x2019;s Day gift bags for the customers.&#x201d; She pursed her lips. &#x201c;But let me think. I ordered those gold-wrapped chocolate coins in bulk and they came packaged inside a cardboard treasure chest. That&#x2019;s where I put the extras.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then lead me to that treasure chest. And they&#x2019;re not for a customer. They&#x2019;re for me,&#x201d; Jenny added. &#x201c;I had to give <i>every </i>customer a zap of energy before they left. They all had the Leprechaun Pie and were as tipsy as sailors on furlough. I was afraid to let them drive or cross the street on foot.&#x201d; She jerked her thumb toward the front of the store. &#x201c;Look what happened when Mr. Jenkins got behind the wheel. Unfortunately for him and a hundred lawn gnomes, he paid his bill and slipped outside before I could touch him. And if I don&#x2019;t eat some chocolate, I won&#x2019;t be able to zap <i>you</i>, Ella Mae.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae scowled. She was Jenny&#x2019;s boss, not some naughty child who could be pinched by one employee and given magical doses of energy by another. She whipped her head around to chastise Jenny, but was overcome by wooziness and stumbled to the closest stool. Putting both hands on the seat to steady herself, she suddenly remembered having placed the extra chocolate coins between containers of cocoa powder and confectioner&#x2019;s sugar. Plunking down onto the stool, she waved at the dry-goods shelves. &#x201c;The treasure chest is on the second shelf from the floor.&#x201d;</p><p>By this time, Reba had finished reading the letter and had placed it on the worktable where Ella Mae did most of her prep work. Two sharp knives were resting on the wooden surface and Reba&#x2019;s hand closed over the paring knife. Her lips were compressed into a thin line and Ella Mae knew she was angry.</p><p>Jenny drew alongside Reba and dumped the treasure chest on the table. &#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she said, handing Reba a chocolate. &#x201c;You look like you could use some candy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never leave home without it,&#x201d; Reba said, taking a fresh licorice twist out of her apron pocket. She tore off an end and chewed furiously while Jenny unwrapped a dozen coins as if her life depended on it.</p><p>While the two women devoured their confections, Ella Mae stared at Hugh&#x2019;s letter. She then slid off the stool and fetched a ball of dough from the walk-in. Shoving the knives and letter to the side, she dusted the surface of the worktable with flour and reached for her rolling pin. She freed the dough from its plastic wrap and began rolling it out, forcing it to grow wider and thinner, wider and thinner.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay. Between the chocolate and the three cans of Mountain Dew I chugged on the front porch, I&#x2019;m starting to feel like myself again,&#x201d; Jenny said. &#x201c;Are you ready, Ella Mae?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just clear the fog in the poor girl&#x2019;s head,&#x201d; Reba said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s had some discouragin&#x2019; news and I want to talk it over with her.&#x201d;</p><p>Before Ella Mae could protest, Jenny put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed. A jolt shot through Ella Mae&#x2019;s body. For a brief, delicious moment, her blood turned to liquid sunshine&#x2014;white hot and radiant&#x2014;and hummed in her veins. Her fatigue evaporated like chimney smoke swept away by the wind and her mind was sharp and focused. &#x201c;Thanks, Jenny,&#x201d; she said, smiling gratefully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still in awe of your gift.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yours isn&#x2019;t too shabby either.&#x201d; Jenny pointed at the round circle of dough. &#x201c;By influencing people&#x2019;s emotions, you can alter their behavior.

If that doesn&#x2019;t pan out, he&#x2019;s going to Greece. He&#x2019;s put his assistant manager in charge of Canine to Five, informed the fire department that he&#x2019;s no longer available to volunteer, and said that I shouldn&#x2019;t wait for him&#x2014;that he&#x2019;s not coming back until he&#x2019;s the man he was before I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She trailed off.</p><p>&#x201c;Before the source of his power was taken and used for the common good,&#x201d; Reba finished for her.</p><p>Ella Mae threw out her hands in exasperation. &#x201c;But he doesn&#x2019;t know that! He doesn&#x2019;t know what I am. I couldn&#x2019;t sit him down and say, &#x2018;Hugh, you&#x2019;re in love with a magical being. Not only can I make charmed pies, but I can also command butterflies.

Sweetheart, he never will be one of us.&#x201d;</p><p>Ella Mae nodded. &#x201c;I know that, but I love him. I&#x2019;ve loved him for most of my life. Since I knew how to love. And no matter what he said in this letter, I&#x2019;ll wait. If it takes twenty years, then so be it. I have to hold on to the hope that, one day, I can be completely honest with him and he&#x2019;ll be able to forgive me for what I did to him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of existence will you have pining for him for twenty years?&#x201d; Reba asked very softly.</p><p>Ella Mae faced her friends. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t plan on pining. You see, I&#x2019;m going to bury everything I feel for Hugh into this pie. And then, I&#x2019;m going to freeze it.

Brooks proves himselfa master at reworking and enriching theconventions of fantasy.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i></b></p><p>With <i>Jarka Ruus</i> Terry Brooks embarks on yet another journey with the legendary Ohmsford family. Beginning 20 years after the conclusion of the <i>The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara</i>, the High Druid of Paranor Grianne Ohmsford finds herself struggling to unite the druids amid political morass risen from her prior history as the dreaded Ilse Witch. Her enemies' schemes come to fruition quickly and she is banished behind the wall of the Forbidding, the anti-demon security feature that collapsed so spectacularly in the magnificent <i>Elfstones of Shannara</i>. Her fate falls in the lap of the youngest Ohmsford, Penderrin, who unlike his Aunt Grianne and his parents is without the gift of magic. Pen along with Khyber and her uncle, the Elven Prince Ahren Elessedil, learn they must jump through the usual Brooks' hoops to unlock the door of the Forbidding and free Grianne.<p> Brooks is right at home in this formulaic addition to the Shannara franchise. All the furniture is here: the Druid Keep of Paranor, dark creatures in pursuit of reluctant young heroes and, of course, the Elfstones. The good news is that Brooks remains a master of description and the book hums along with comfortable ease. Devout Shannara fans will find their favorite magical realm exactly as they left it and no doubt anticipate this cliffhanger's sequel. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>More than a quarter of a century after "The Sword of Shannara carved out its place in the pantheon of great epic fantasy, the magic of Terry Brooks's "New York Times bestselling saga burns as brightly as ever. Three complete series have chronicled the ever-unfolding history of Shannara. But more stories are still to be told--and new adventures have yet to be undertaken. Book One of High Druid of Shannara invites both the faithful longtime reader and the curious newcomer to take the first step on the next extraordinary quest. <br>Twenty years have passed since Grianne Ohmsford denounced her former life as the dreaded Ilse Witch--saved by the love of her brother, the magic of the Sword of Shannara, and the destruction of her evil mentor, the Morgawr. Now, fulfilling the destiny predicted for her, she has established the Third Druid Council, and dedicated herself to its goals of peace, harmony among the races, and defense of the Four Lands. But the political intrigue, secret treachery, and sinister deeds that have haunted Druid history for generations continue to thrive. And despite her devotion to the greater good as Ard Rhys--the High Druid of Paranor, Grianne still has bitter enemies. <br>Among the highest ranks of the Council she leads lurk those who cannot forget her reign of terror as the Ilse Witch, who covet her seat of power, and who will stop at nothing to see her deposed . . . or destroyed. Even Grianne's few allies--chief among them her trusted servant Tagwen--know of the plots against her. But they could never anticipate the sudden, ominous disappearance of the Ard Rhys, in the dead of night and without a trace. Now, barely a step ahead of the dark forces bent on stopping him, Tagwen joins Grianne's brave young nephew, Pen Ohmsford, and the wise, powerful elf Ahren Elessedil on a desperate and dangerous mission of search and rescue--to deliver the High Druid of Shannara from an unspeakable fate. <br>Expect no end of wonders, no shortage of adventure, exhilaration, suspense, and enchantment, as Terry Brooks demonstrates, once again, that there is no end to his magic of invention and mastery of storytelling. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p></p><h2>The Holy Qur&#39;an: Roman Transliteration, with orginal Arabic Text and English translation</h2><p>The Holy Qur'an is ideal for individuals who do not know how to read Arabic script.

Following a midlife career shift, Harrison Hobliztelle, or Hob as he was called, a former professor of comparative literature at Barnard, Columbia, and Brandeis University, became a family therapist and was ordained a Dharmacharya (senior teacher) by Thich Nhat Hanh. Hob comes to life in these pages as an incredibly funny and brilliant man who never stopped enjoying a good philosophical conversation-even as his mind, quite literally, slipped away from him. And yet when they first heard the diagnosis, Olivia and Hob's initial reaction was to cling desperately to the life they had had. But everything had changed, and they knew that the only answer was to greet this last phase of Hob's life consciously and lovingly. <br><br> <i>Ten Thousand Joys &amp; Ten Thousand Sorrows</i> provides a wise and compassionate vision for maintaining hope and grace in the face of life's greatest challenges. <br><br> (This memoir was originally self-published as <i>The Majesty of Your Loving</i>.)</p><p><b>Olivia Ames Hoblitzelle</b>&nbsp;is a writer, therapist, and teacher. She has worked&nbsp;to bring meditation, yoga, and cognitive therapy into the medical domain to treat stress-related and chronic illnesses. She also&nbsp;helped to develop one of the first training programs in mind/body medicine in the country and trained health professionals through Harvard Medical School. After teaching meditation and cognitive therapy for more than 30 years, her focus now is on elder issues, conscious aging, and spirituality. Hoblitzelle has two adult children and four grandchildren.Both Hoblitzelle and her husband of nearly 40 years, Hob, practiced the Buddhist methods of acceptance and letting go to graceful effect in dealing with Hob' s symptoms of Alzheimer' s. In this thoughtful narrative, Hoblitzelle explains that at age 72, Hob, a former English professor, was diagnosed with the disease, having experienced odd moments of disconnect and forgetfulness; his condition gradually declined until his death six years later. The author, 14 years his junior, records her compassionate side-by-side journey with her husband, mindful of their remaining time together and resolved to face the disease and its challenges rather than deny it. As a man of words, Hob grew deeply distressed by his aphasia, and the author details the stages of Hob' s debilitation--which he accepted with humor and lightness--mostly in terms of his painful lapse into the inarticulable. Much of the barrage of wisdom she sought from Tibetan elders sounds blithe and pat out of context, but Hoblitzelle frankly expresses the growing sense of disconnection between them and the burdens of caretaking, and at the end of each chapter offers helpful suggestions for those dealing with the disease. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The information contained in Colonel Gracie's story is available from no other source. He provides details of the final moments, including names of passengers pulled from the ocean and of those men who, in a panic, jumped into lifeboats as they were being lowered. Walter Lord, author of <i>A Night to Remember</i>, calls Gracie "an indefatigable detective." John Thayer was, like Gracie, one of the last to leave the ship. His account, <i>The Sinking of the S.S. Titanic</i>, is meticulously detailed. The sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> was, in his eyes, a symbol of the end of the world that he knew, and the beginning of a frightening new era.</p></p><p><b>Colonel Archibald Gracie IV</b> was an American writer, real estate investor, and survivor of the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i>. Gracie was a member of the prominent Gracie family, which had built the famed Gracie Mansion, currently the residence of the mayor of New York City. He wrote two books, <i>The Truth About Chickamauga</i> and <i>The Truth About the Titanic</i>, a detailed account of the sinking from a survivor's perspective. Gracie's health suffered as a result of the ordeal, and he passed away less than eight months later, his dying words being "We must get them all into the boats." <b>John B.Thayer</b> was 17 at the time he escaped from death in the sinking of the Titanic.The fabulous remake of the film Titanic did more than launch Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s movie career.

Never have so many people experimented with democratic institutions. At the same time, traditional strategies of economic development have collapsed in Eastern Europe and Latin America and entire economic systems are being transformed on both continents. What should we expect in the countries that venture on the paths to democracy and markets? Will these transitions result in democracies or in new dictatorships? What economic system, new or old, will emerge? This major book analyzes recent events in Eastern Europe and Latin America, focusing on transitions to democracy and market-oriented economic reforms. The author underscores the interdependence of political and economic transformations and draws on extensive local data as part of his analysis. A distinctive feature of the book is that it employs models derived from politics, economics, and game theory.

This introduction to the Western esoteric traditions offers a concise overview of their historical development.<br> <br> Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke explores these traditions, from their roots in Hermeticism, Neo-Platonism, and Gnosticism in the early Christian era up to their reverberations in today's scientific paradigms. While the study of Western esotericism is usually confined to the history of ideas, Goodrick-Clarke examines the phenomenon much more broadly. He demonstrates that, far from being a strictly intellectual movement, the spread of esotericism owes a great deal to geopolitics and globalization. In Hellenistic culture, for example, the empire of Alexander the Great, which stretched across Egypt and Western Asia to provinces in India, facilitated a mixing of Eastern and Western cultures. As the Greeks absorbed ideas from Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, and Persia, they gave rise to the first esoteric movements.<br> <br> From the late sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, post-Reformation spirituality found expression in theosophy, Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. Similarly, in the modern era, dissatisfaction with the hegemony of science in Western culture and a lack of faith in traditional Christianity led thinkers like Madame Blavatsky to look East for spiritual inspiration. Goodrick-Clarke further examines Modern esoteric thought in the light of new scientific and medical paradigms along with the analytical psychology of Carl Gustav Jung. This book traces the complete history of these movements and is the definitive account of Western esotericism.<br></p><p>Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke is Chair of Western Esotericism and Director of the Centre for the Study of Western Esotericism at the University of Exeter<br>"A fine, concise summary of Western esoteric traditions from ancient Hellenic and Egyptian sources to the contemporary era. ...Excellent chapter-end bibliographies, detailed notes, and fine summaries make the key elements in this important but opaque tradition understandable to newcomers to the topic." <br> <br>--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Philoctetes (Greek Tragedy in New Translations)</h2><p>Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly re-create the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the Greek Tragedy in New Translations series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the poetry of the originals. Under the general editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shapiro, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the play.<br>En route to fight the Trojan War, the Greek army has abandoned Philoctetes, after the smell of his festering wound, mysteriously received from a snakebite at a shrine on a small island off Lemnos, makes it unbearable to keep him on ship. Ten years later, an oracle makes it clear that the war cannot be won without the assistance of Philoctetes and his famous bow, inherited from Hercules himself. <em>Philoctetes</em> focuses on the attempt of Neoptolemus and the hero Odysseus to persuade the bowman to sail with them to Troy. First, though, they must assuage his bitterness over having been abandoned, and then win his trust. But how should they do this--through trickery, or with the truth? To what extent do the ends justify the means? To what degree should personal integrity be compromised for the sake of public duty? These are among the questions that Sophocles puts forward in this, one of his most morally complex and penetrating plays.<br></p><p><br><strong>Carl Phillips</strong> is a well-known poet and Professor of English and African and Afro-American Studies at Washington University.

But what <br>began then as an apprenticeship at La Varenne �cole de Cuisine evolved into a lifelong immersion in French cuisine and culture, culminating in permanent residency in 1994. <i>On Rue Tatin </i>chronicles her journey to an ancient little street in Louviers, one of Normandy&#x2019;s most picturesque towns. <br><br>With lyrical prose and wry candor, Loomis recalls the miraculous restoration that she and her husband performed on the dilapidated convent they chose for their new residence. As its ochre and azure floor tiles emerged, challenges outside the dwelling mounted. From squatters to a surly priest next door, along with a close-knit community wary of outsiders, Loomis tackled the social challenges head-on, through persistent dialogue&#x2013;and baking. <br><br><i>On Rue Tatin </i>includes delicious recipes that evoke the essence of this region, such as Apple and Thyme Tart, Duck Breast with Cider, and Braised Chicken in White Wine and Mustard. Transporting readers to a world where tradition is cherished, <i>On Rue Tatin </i>provides a touching glimpse of the camaraderie, exquisite food, and simple pleasures of daily life in a truly glorious corner of Normandy.</p><p>It has been said that food defines a culture. For the French, food is an integral part of their coveted tradition, and Susan Herrmann Loomis's new book <i>On Rue Tatin</i> embraces both. As a young, recent American college graduate, Loomis left the U.S. for France to attend one of the oldest French cooking schools, La Varenne. Her intent was to immerse herself in French cooking with the aspiration of becoming a food critic. Working as the French equivalent of an apprentice, she quickly became intimate with the ways and traditions that define the French culture, specifically its cuisine. <i>On Rue Tatin</i> ("On Tatin Street") is a descriptive narrative of Loomis's first several years in France, her encounters with the local people, and the bonds she formed, as well as recipes she gathered during her time there.<p> Following her formal culinary training, Loomis returned to the U.S. and met the man who would become her husband. After the couple's first son turned 2, they moved to France where Loomis was determined to launch her writing career focusing on unique aspects of French farming cuisine. She and her husband eventually purchased an old monastery in Louviers in the Normandy region of France. One of the more humorous and memorable stories she shares concerns the landlord of the small rental that they occupied for a year while her husband remodeled the monastery to livable conditions. During that year, the wife of the landlord believed them to be CIA agents and chose to keep a cold distance from the family. Meanwhile the French police suspected them of dealing drugs.</p><p> Every recipe featured throughout this memoir comes with an interesting, anecdotal story, and is very much representative of traditional French cuisine. Gateau au Chocolat de Mamy (or Mamy Jacqueline's Chocolate Cake) is a dense, almost death-by-chocolate confection, but served alone or with a fresh fruit coulis, it will bring a smile, as will the sweet explanation of its origin.</p><p> Loomis describes experiences and people with much detail, sometimes several times over, and her prose allows the reader to imagine the tempting smells and vivid colors of the countryside. You may find yourself wishing to see pictures of Loomis's home and the quaint village where she lived, but perhaps that was Loomis's intent--she wants to tempt and challenge you to experience the beauty and foods of Louviers and the Normandy region for yourself. <i>--Teresa Simanton</i></p>"Where many American writers merely love France, Susan Loomis knows it: its smells and people and manners . . . she is as natural a writer as she is a chef." <br>&#x2013;Adam Gopnik, author of <i>Paris to the Moon<br></i><br>"Susan Loomis has written a radiant love letter to France&#x2013;particularly Normandy&#x2013;its countryside, food, markets, and people. Buy it and settle down for good reading and an occasional sortie into the kitchen." <br>&#x2013;Barbara Kafka, author of <i>Soup: A Way of Life<br><br></i>"Susan Loomis shares with us her rich family life, a world of amazing French friendships, and proves, most of all, that each and every dream CAN come true!" <br>&#x2013;Patricia Wells, author of <i>Patricia Wells at Home in Provence</i><br><br><i><br></i></p><h2>Tepper Isn&#39;t Going Out: A Novel</h2><p>Murray Tepper would say that he is an ordinary New Yorker who is simply trying to read the newspaper in peace. But he reads while sitting behind the wheel of his parked car, and his car always seems to be in a particularly desirable parking spot. Not surprisingly, he is regularly interrupted by drivers who want to know if he is going out.<br><br>Tepper isn&#x2019;t going out. Why not? His explanations tend to be rather literal&#x2014;the indisputable fact, for instance, that he has twenty minutes left on the meter.<br><br>But once New Yorkers become aware of Tepper, some of them begin to suspect that he knows something they don&#x2019;t. And an ever-increasing number of them are willing to line up for the opportunity to sit in his car with him and find out what it is.<br><br><b>Tepper Isn&#x2019;t Going Out </b>is a wise and witty story of an ordinary man who, perhaps innocently, changes the world around him.</p><p>New York City and America's car culture smash together in Calvin Trillin's <i>Tepper Isn't Going Out</i>, a humorous tale of the urban quest for an open parking space. When a mailing-list broker, Murray Tepper, decides to spend his days plugging meters so he can sit in his car reading newspapers and waive off suitors hopeful of gaining his spot, little does he know that his odd behavior (even by New York standards) will set off a media buzz, provide him with cult-hero status, and incur reproach from the paranoid, dour Mayor Frank Ducavelli, who focuses on curtailing Tepper's "abuse" of the parking meter system. <p> Granted, the plot of this novel is quite thin, but, while not leaving you in stitches, Trillin provokes many smirks and smiles with his wit. For instance, he writes of magazines titled <i>Beautiful Spot: A Magazine of Parking</i> and the potential of <i>Spin: The Magazine of Salad Drying</i>. When Tepper suggests that his friend Jack leave his car's flashers on while parked illegally, Jack responds: </p><blockquote>And draw attention to myself? Not a chance. I always park in front of hydrants. The secret is to park smack in front of them rather than just too near them. You have to go all the way. If you're smack in front of them, the cop rolling down the street can't see that there's a hydrant there at all. You have to be brazen. That's my motto, in parking and in life: be brazen.</blockquote> Trillin's book should appeal to commuters and city dwellers everywhere, and anyone else looking for a chuckle. <i>--Michael Ferch</i>&#x201c;Good for smiles, guffaws, and sometimes laughter that brings tears.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;Beginning, middle, and end are equally charming....Nothing can take away from this novel&#x2019;s delight.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post<br></i><br>&#x201c;[Told] with great, cranky affection [and] an irresistible way of mixing the quotidian with the absurd.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br> &#x201c;Trillin is at his charmingly funny best in this good-humored satire.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p><h2>Color Me Your Way 5</h2><p><i>Color Me 5</i> is the fifth book in the bestselling <i>Color Me Your Way</i> series.

She lives in Decatur, Georgia, with her husband and their two children.</strong></p> <p><strong>Joshilyn Jackson: </strong>Dixie Clay&#x2019;s relationship with the orphan who falls into her care captures the visceral experience of Baby Love. My own kids are 11 and 16 now, but reading those passages, I had an almost physical response, a wave of something stronger than nostalgia. Can you talk about how you created this relationship? </p> <p><strong>Beth Ann Fennelly:</strong> Short version: I got knocked up. Tommy and I enjoyed a romantic trip to Provence, and I came home with food poisoning. After three weeks of not shaking the bug, it dawned on us&#x2014;my &#x201c;food poisoning&#x201d; was a fetus. Sweet baby Nolan re-immersed us into the joys of the hands-on, every minute parenting of an infant (by then our &#x201c;bigs&#x201d; were turning ten and six). The physical rituals of feeding and bathing and diapering him synced me with Dixie Clay&#x2019;s bodily rhythms. Mothers, I think, are hungry to see motherhood portrayed accurately in books. I know I am. And writing about a baby gave me an excuse to do what I really wanted to do anyway&#x2014;study the marvelous creature that we&#x2019;d somehow created. </p> <p><strong>JJ: </strong><em>The Tilted World</em> is set against the dynamic backdrop of The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. I&#x2019;d never heard of it until I read your book. Why do you think it&#x2019;s such a lost part of our history? How did you find it?</p> <p><strong>BAF:</strong> I think because so many of the people affected were poor Southerners&#x2014;many of them black sharecroppers&#x2014;the scale of the tragedy wasn&#x2019;t registered by those who write history. But folks still talk about it here, and after Katrina, it was on a lot of people&#x2019;s minds. There&#x2019;s also an amazing nonfiction book about the flood called <em>Rising Tide</em>, by John M. Barry.</p> <p><strong>JJ: </strong>Music, especially blues and jazz, plays an important role in <em>The Tilted World</em>. How important is music in your own lives?</p> <p><strong>Tom Franklin:</strong> We both love music of all kinds (we recently saw Willie Nelson and Snoop Dogg perform in the same month), but especially enjoy Mississippi blues. During the flood, the blues was more than entertainment&#x2014;it was soul-affirming. So many people were thrown together on the levee with nothing to do besides stare at the water&#x2014;blues gave them a way to grieve and dream.</p> <p><strong>JJ: </strong>A married couple&#x2014;both successful writers with very different visions and distinct voices&#x2014;decides to write a novel together. It sounds like a recipe for divorce, disaster, or both. Yet here you are, you&#x2019;re still best friends, and the book is wonderful. How did the collaboration come about? </p> <p><strong>TF:</strong>When my cousin heard we were writing a book together, he said, &#x201c;High stakes poker, Tom.&#x201d;</p> <p>But it wasn&#x2019;t. Instead, it turned out to be one of the best writing experiences of our lives. What happened was we&#x2019;d written a collaborative short story, and after it was published, our agent, Nat Sobel, saw the story in a magazine and called me. &#x201c;You should expand this story for your next novel,&#x201d; he told me. &#x201c;And you two should write it together.&#x201d; Beth Ann took some convincing. As a poet, she&#x2019;d always joked that fiction was a &#x201c;lower art,&#x201d; but after enough wheedling she decided to try it. It was fun to write together, fun to inhabit that world with her.

Ned Henry shuttles between the 1940s and the twenty-first century while researching Coventry Cathedral for a patron interested in rebuilding it until the time continuum is disrupted.</p><p><i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a science-fiction fantasy in the guise of an old-fashioned Victorian novel, complete with epigraphs, brief outlines, and a rather ugly boxer in three-quarters profile at the start of each chapter. Or is it a Victorian novel in the guise of a time-traveling tale, or a highly comic romp, or a great, allusive literary game, complete with spry references to Dorothy L. Sayers, Wilkie Collins, and Arthur Conan Doyle? Its title is the subtitle of Jerome K. Jerome's singular, and hilarious, <i>Three Men in a Boat</i>. In one scene the hero, Ned Henry, and his friends come upon Jerome, two men, and the dog Montmorency in--you guessed it--a boat. Jerome will later immortalize Ned's fumbling. (Or, more accurately, Jerome will <i>earlier</i> immortalize Ned's fumbling, because Ned is from the 21st century and Jerome from the 19th.) <p> What Connie Willis soon makes clear is that genre can go to the dogs. <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a fine, and fun, romance--an amused examination of conceptions and misconceptions about other eras, other people. When we first meet Ned, in 1940, he and five other time jumpers are searching bombed-out Coventry Cathedral for the bishop's bird stump, an object about which neither he nor the reader will be clear for hundreds of pages. All he knows is that if they don't find it, the powerful Lady Schrapnell will keep sending them back in time, again and again and again. Once he's been whisked through the rather quaint Net back to the Oxford future, Ned is in a state of super time-lag. (Willis is happily unconcerned with futuristic <i>vraisemblance</i>, though Ned makes some obligatory references to "vids," "interactives," and "headrigs.") The only way Ned can get the necessary two weeks' R and R is to perform one more drop and recuperate in the past, away from Lady Schrapnell. Once he returns something to someone (he's too exhausted to understand what or to whom) on June 7, 1888, he's free. </p><p> Willis <i>is</i> concerned, however, as is her confused character, with getting Victoriana right, and Ned makes a good amateur anthropologist--entering one crowded room, he realizes that "the reason Victorian society was so restricted and repressed was that it was impossible to move without knocking something over." Though he's still not sure what he's supposed to bring back, various of his confederates keep popping back to set him to rights. <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a shaggy-dog tale complete with a preternaturally quiet, time-traveling cat, Princess Arjumand, who might well be the cause of some serious temporal incongruities--for even a mouser might change the course of European history. In the end, readers might well be more interested in Ned's romance with a fellow historian than in the bishop's bird stump, and who will not rejoice in their first Net kiss, which lasts 169 years!</p>Praise for Connie Willis's Hugo and Nebula Award-Winning <i>Doomsday Book:</i><p>"A tour de force." <br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"... stunning...the best work yet from one of science fiction's best writers."<br><i>--The Denver Post</i></p><p>A Publishers Weekly Best Book of 1997:<br>"Displaying the skills that have won her more major SF awards than any other writer of the decade, Willis juggles comedy of manners, hard science theory and a host of literary references in this sophisticated dazzlement."<br>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"An utter delight.

He is known for writing manga adaptations of AM Driver and Mushiking: King of the Beetles, along with Saiyuki Hiro Go-Ku Den!, Chohenshin Gag Gaiden!! Card Warrior Kamen Riders, Go-Go-Go Saiyuki: Shin Gokuden and more.Gr 4 Up&#x2014;Nate Adams finds a weird creature that identifies itself as Whisper the Yo-Kai butler. Whisper gives Nate a magical watch and follows him around explaining how to use it. The creature also tells the protagonist about the world of the Yo-Kai. They are magical creatures (originally from Japanese folklore) that are everywhere but are invisible to most humans. By using the watch, Nate is able to see and summon them. Many of the Yo-Kai have strange powers, such as one with a gloomy aura that makes anyone near it depressed. Others are even more surreal, like a sword-wielding cicada or a rice cake creature that punishes a boy who threw away rice cakes instead of eating them. Once the basic premise is set up, the story continues at a rapid pace as Nate meets more and more of these creatures. Whenever the boy needs help, he has to decide which Yo-Kai he will summon to help him. The action is fast and funny, and Konishi's artwork matches the exaggerated humor of the story with a Tex Avery style. VERDICT For fans of the Yo-Kai Watch anime and video games, as well as fans of Pokemon and other kid-friendly manga that feature plenty of action and strange monsters.&#x2014;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</p><h2>Sacred Number: The Secret Quality of Quantities (Wooden Books)</h2><p><p>Numbers permeate every aspect of our lives; very little happens without a basic ability to manipulate the simple whole numbers we all take for granted.

Grant began taking a series of Confederate strongholds in 1861, climaxing with the siege of Vicksburg two years later. For Grant and the Union it was a crucial success that captured the Mississippi River, divided the South in half, and set the stage for eventual victory. <br><br><i>Vicksburg, 1863</i> brings the battles and the protagonists of this struggle to life: we see Grant in all his grim determination, Sherman with his feistiness and talent for war, and Confederate leaders from Jefferson Davis to Joe Johnston to John Pemberton. It is an epic account by a masterful writer and historian.</p><p>Winston Groom is the author of twenty previous books, including <i>Forrest Gump</i>, <i>Conversations with the Enemy </i>(Pulitzer Prize finalist), <i>Shiloh 1862</i>, and <i>The Generals</i>. He served in Vietnam with the Fourth Infantry Division and lives in Point Clear, Alabama.Admiral Porter had his own ideas for the Rebels&#x2019; undoing, which presently had nothing to do with armies or canals or amphibious landings. Instead, after correctly identifying the two main objectives of the Mississippi campaign, he just as correctly proceeded to separate them. One, of course, was to reopen the river to commercial traffic from the Midwest to the Gulf and thence to ports far and wide. Desirable as this was, it would still require the reduction of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, which only the army could accomplish, and they weren&#x2019;t getting anywhere fast. From a purely military standpoint, however, the second goal was even more vital, and that was to sever the Confederate connection between the bountiful lands of the trans- Mississippi, since the ultimate destination of their bounty was the Rebel armies of Virginia, Tennessee, and Mississippi.<br><br>In sheer size, the trans- Mississippi was nearly as large as the rest of the Confederacy east of the river. Up until then it had provided the South with more than 100,000 soldiers, about 30 percent of the number presently serving under arms. Perhaps even more significantly, the trans- Mississippi was an inexhaustible granary that supplied much of the beef, corn, hogs, rice, wheat, and staples that filled stockpiles in Atlanta and Richmond. Not only that, but because of the blockade it also was a major conduit of European arms, munitions, and medical supplies through supposedly neutral Mexico. Cut off the supplies, Porter reasoned, and the enemy armies would begin to wither and starve. His view was later shared by no less an authority than the Harvard historian and philosopher John Fiske, who wrote in 1900, &#x201c;To sever from the Confederacy its three trans- Mississippi states was an object of paramount importance. It would destroy nearly half its resisting power.&#x201d;<br><br>This Confederate pipeline had already suffered a major blow with the fall of Memphis, and Sherman, before going up the Yazoo to attack Chickasaw Bluffs, had seen to the destruction of the Shreveport and Vicksburg Railroad. While these actions went a long way toward cutting the connection, it still left almost three hundred miles of the Mississippi under Rebel control all the way down to Port Hudson, and it was upon this stretch that Porter cast his nautical eye. He already knew he could get his ironclads past the Vicksburg batteries&#x2014;albeit with the inevitably heavy damage&#x2014;and once below there would be no sustainable source of coal, and the fireboxes of the ironclad ships were not designed for burning wood. Porter was still trying to figure a way to solve that problem when a catalyst arrived in the shape of a big Confederate riverboat named City of Vicksburg that steamed up from the South laden with supplies and tied up at the town docks. The brazenness of this prompted the admiral to summon his newest charge, Colonel Charles Rivers Ellet, who a scant six months earlier had been a nineteen- year- old medical cadet. Following the death of his father during the Battle of Memphis, young Ellet now commanded the army ram fleet, which, over the protest of Secretary of War Stanton, had just been turned over to the navy. Porter now wanted to know if Ellet thought it was possible to send in one of his rams to sink the City of Vicksburg, which, to his eternal annoyance and disgust, was lying in plain sight of his flagship.*<br><br>Ellet replied that it was not only possible but, with himself in command, it was as good as done. Thus in the early hours of February 2, 1863, Ellet began sneaking downriver in Queen of the West, his best ram, which could burn either coal or wood. Elaborate preparations had been taken according to Porter&#x2019;s instructions, or so the admiral believed. Double bales of cotton had been placed around the decks to fortify against Confederate cannon shot, a nighttime attack had been ordered to minimize the danger from Rebel batteries, and Ellet had been told to strike the City of Vicksburg just aft of her wheel, then blast her with turpentine- encased shot in order to set her ablaze.<br><br>Everything was going according to plans until Ellet decided to change them. Told to attack while it was still dark, he dallied around with last- minute preparations so that it was after sunrise before he got into position, and by then the Vicksburg guns were on full alert. As in the ill- fated attempt to ram the Arkansas, a big river eddy caught Queen of the West just as she was bearing in and her blow glanced off. She fired her turpentine balls, setting Vicksburg afire, but the Rebel guns began exacting a stern toll. The cotton bales Ellet had layered around the superstructure caught fire and all hands were ordered out into the hail of enemy fire to shove them overboard. By then it was apparent no more could be done and, while hundreds of Vicksburgians ran onto the bluffs to watch, the Queen, still ablaze and being shot at by every gun in the batteries, bore off toward the western shore where Sherman had some batteries of his own.<br><br>After putting out the fire and looking things over, Ellet decided his damage was slight and Porter told him to push on downriver in search of Confederate supply ships. He was accompanied by the unarmed river steamer De Soto, which Sherman had lent him as a support vessel and safety valve, if trouble should occur. The first Rebel boat he caught up with was typical of the haul that was crossing on a daily basis from the trans- Mississippi. She was the steamer A. H. Baker, carrying 110,000 pounds of barreled pork, some five hundred live hogs, several tons of salt, and other sundries, bound for Port Hudson and points east. Thus encouraged, Ellet continued on his rampage.<br><br>By then the Confederates had put out the alarm but, even so, a number of their transports failed to get the word and were taken captive, including one boat with a party of women from New Orleans aboard, whose destination seemed to be Port Hudson. Porter floated down a barge of coal for Ellet, which he recovered and hid up a bayou, then began a campaign of pillage on the smaller streams feeding into the Mississippi. At one point he stopped at a plantation near Grand Gulf that had belonged to former president Zachary Taylor and appropriated its cotton. He sent parties of his &#x201c;marines&#x201d; ashore with orders to destroy enemy wagon trains and, if fired upon from the banks, burn the plantation homes nearby. After two weeks of this he made his first reckless mistake, violating Porter&#x2019;s orders to stay near the mouth of the Red River.<br><br>Full of as much steam as his boilers, Ellet took the Queen eighty miles up the Red River to see about a big gun the Confederates were rumored to be landing there. On the way he captured a steamer with 4,500 bushels of corn, a number of Confederate soldiers, and a German with $32,000 in his pocket. When he arrived at the place the gun was supposed to be delivered to, Ellet not only found himself bracketed and shot through and through by Rebel guns, but he got stuck on a sandbar and had to abandon ship, leaving the Queen in enemy hands. He and most of his crew escaped on the De Soto, which was following close behind, but she also ran aground and they were forced to re-escape on the captured Confederate corn boat.<br><br>For two days Ellet and his men desperately eluded a host of angry Rebel steamers that were now looking for him in every part of the river system. Out of food and fuel, the crew fed the corn into the engine&#x2019;s fireboxes and ate what was left, and it seemed only a matter of time before their unarmed boat would be apprehended. Then salvation appeared out of a Mississippi River fog in the form of the new ironclad Indianola, which Porter presciently had sent downriver when communications with Ellet were lost. After conferring with Indianola&#x2019;s captain, and explaining what had happened, Ellet and his people went north toward Vicksburg, assuming their mission had been accomplished. In Porter&#x2019;s eyes, it was nothing of the sort, for he viewed the loss of Queen of the West as a major defeat. &#x201c;I can give orders, but I cannot give officers good judgment,&#x201d; he telegraphed the secretary of the navy. &#x201c;The Indianola is now there by herself. Whether the commander will have the good sense not to be surprised, remains to be seen.&#x201d;<br><br>It did not take long for Porter to find out. Indianola&#x2019;s captain hung around for two extra days, by which time the Confederates had not only repaired and manned Queen of the West but also sicced upon him the formidable William H. Webb, a converted steam ram. On the moonlit night of February 24, these two caught up with the Yankee gunboat about twenty- five miles south of Vicksburg. In the ensuing battle, the mighty Indianola got herself sunk in ten feet of water and her crew made prisoners, and Porter&#x2019;s humiliation was complete, or so it seemed. But then there occurred one of those weird and wonderful incidents, which on the rarest of occasions can make war actually seem like fun.<br><br>Next morning, after Porter recovered from his fury over losing the Indianola, he concocted a delicious plot to keep her from falling into Rebel hands. First he commandeered a large river flatboat and set a veritable army of carpenters to work, dolling her up like a Union ironclad. By late afternoon, the barge had been extended to more than three hundred feet long, with forty- foot- high enclosed paddle wheel&#x2013;houses made out of a cabin hauled from a nearby plantation, two tall smokestacks of nailed- together barrels set upon smoldering tar pots, and a big &#x201c;Quaker gun&#x201d; that poked menacingly forward. To conceal the hasty work, the dummy ship was plastered with tar and christened &#x201c;Black Terror,&#x201d; complete with the Stars and Stripes flying from a flagstaff. As a finishing touch, some wag nailed a sign on its side: deluded people, cave in! The finished cost of the hoax ship, Porter claimed, had been $8.63. Just before midnight a Union towboat dragged the creature around to the bend above Vicksburg and cut it loose downriver.<br><br>When the Confederate batteries sighted it in the moonlight they assumed it was real and opened fire, but the current carried &#x201c;Black Terror&#x201d; rapidly past with no observable damage. It hit a sandbar just off DeSoto Point, but Sherman&#x2019;s people rowed out and shoved it off. Meanwhile, Confederate headquarters at Vicksburg had fired off a warning that a big Yankee ironclad was on the loose south of the city and ordered the salvage parties attempting to raise Indianola to demolish her, rather than let her be retaken. Just as the sun was setting, Rebel scouts reported &#x201c;Black Terror&#x201d; lying off the western shore not far above where the recovery operation was in progress. Actually she was aground again, but that was all it took; Queen of the West and the William H. Webb, which had been standing by, promptly came about and took off downriver, while the Rebel salvage party blew up Indianola with her own gunpowder. For a while, Pemberton and his army became laughingstocks, not just in the North but throughout the Confederacy as well.<br><br>For his part, Porter had partially redeemed himself by the dummy ironclad trick, but the fact remained that two of his fleet&#x2019;s most powerful ships, Queen of the West and Indianola, were either sunk or in the hands of the enemy, and thus ended the U.S. Navy&#x2019;s forays into the Rebel- held part of the Mississippi until further notice.</p><h2>The Way of Prayer: A Commentary on Saint Teresa&#39;s Way of Perfection</h2><p><p>This acclaimed commentary on Saint Teresa of Avila's classic work, <i>Way of Perfection</i>, discusses the various forms of Christian prayer, with an emphasis on Teresa's meditation on the Our Father. The author, a renowned expert on Carmelite spirituality, includes many quotations from Saint Teresa and Saint John of the Cross, which have been conformed to the most current authorized translations.</p><p>Teresa of Avila reformed the Carmelite order in the sixteenth century. Seeing Teresa in deep prayer, her first companions asked her to teach them how to pray. The apostles made the same request of Jesus: "Teach us to pray." Jesus answered by teaching the Our Father. Teresa responded to her sisters by writing <i>Way of Perfection</i>, which contains an extended commentary upon the Lord's Prayer. As Jesus did in his Sermon on the Mount, Teresa, in her <i>Way of Perfection</i>, first teaches the necessary dispositions for prayer before teaching the different kinds of prayer.</p><p>Named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI in 1970, Teresa united not only prayer and the apostolate, but contemplation and the apostolate, for contemplation is a particular kind of prayer that tends toward the most sublime intimacy with our Lord.</p></p><p><p><b>Father Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalen, O.C.D.</b>, (1893&#x2013;1953), was a Carmelite priest and a revered master of the spiritual life. He was an expert in the spiritual and mystical doctrine of Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. He is the author of <i>Divine Intimacy</i>, a four volume series published in a digital format by Ignatius Press, which offers daily meditations arranged according to the liturgical season.</p>"Father Gabriel's book beautifully explains the way of Saint Teresa in showing us how to pray. He uses the experience of his monastic community to provide a reliable guide for all Christians to draw closer to God by contemplative prayer." --<b>Father Joseph Koterski, S.J.</b>, Professor of Philosophy, Fordham University</p><h2>Monster Theory: Reading Culture</h2><p>Monsters provide a key to understanding the culture that spawned them. So argues the essays in this wide-ranging collection that asks the question, what happens when critical theorists take the study of monsters seriously as a means of examining our culture? In viewing the monstrous body as metaphor for the cultural body, the contributors consider beasts, demons, freaks, and fiends as symbolic expressions of very real fears and desires, signs of cultural unease that pervade society and shape its collective behaviour. Through a sampling of monsters as a conceptual category, these essays argue that our fascination for the monstrous testifies to our continued desire to explore the difference, prohibition and the everchanging borders of possibility. Topics treated include: the connection between Beowulf, Frankenstein&#39;s monster, Dracula, and Dr Jekyll&#39;s Hyde; the fascination with Chang and Eng, the Siamese twins in 1830s America, and what it has to say about anxieties regarding the recently united states; the idea of monstrosity in Anne Rice&#39;s Vampire Chronicles; the use of monstrosity in medieval anti-muslim polemics; and an exploration of the creation myth embedded in Jurassic Park.</p><p></p><h2>Tropisms (New Directions Pearls)</h2><p><p><strong>Nathalie Sarraute's stunning debut&#x2015;vignettes of "inner movements"&#x2015;foreshadowed the rise of the nouveau roman.</strong></p> Hailed as a masterpiece by Jean Genet, Marguerite Duras, and Jean-Paul Sartre, <em>Tropisms</em> is considered one of the defining texts of the nouveau roman movement. Nathalie Sarraute has defined her work as the &#x201c;movements that are hidden under the commonplace, harmless instances of our everyday lives.&#x201d; Like figures in a grainy photograph, Sarraute&#x2019;s characters are blurred and shadowy, while her narrative never develops beyond a stressed moment.

Unlike the Rosicrucian manifestoes, which address the transformation of society, The Chemical Wedding is concerned with the inner transformation of the soul. It is a deeply interior work, one which asks the reader to step into its world of symbols and walk with Christian Rosenkreutz along his path of transformation. Despite its importance as a key text of the Western esoteric traditions, this is the first ever contemporary English translation of The Chemical Wedding, made especially for this edition by Joscelyn Godwin. Also included in this edition is an introduction and commentary by Adam McLean, which illuminates the transformative symbolism.</p><p><b>Joscelyn Godwin</b> is a composer, musicologist and translator, known for his work on ancient music, paganism and music in the occult.

Gary Cooper fucked Barbara Stanwyck on the couch I was perched on. Brenda swore that the rumor was true.<br><br> I felt disembodied.

Shoptalk is the only sort of talk that Miss Katherine Lake enjoys.&#x201d;<br><br> I laughed and picked at my food. Brenda and Elmer were nearly ten years older than I. They were professionals; I was a cop&#x2019;s quasi- girlfriend. The disparity rankled. We all went back to Bobby De Witt and the Boulevard-Citizens job. Open secrets and unspoken truths began germinating there. I wanted to peddle myself to wash the stink of Bobby off of me; Brenda refused to let me do it.

Princess-obsessed Ruby receives a card inviting her to have tea on Sunday with the Queen. As she rushes to tell everyone about her forthcoming engagement, family members, teachers, and friends remind her to adhere to various social graces such as saying "please" and "thank you," not interrupting, and chewing with her mouth closed. The story is simple and clever, and not at all didactic. Glasser paints Ruby as an impetuous, rosy-cheeked girl with a creative imagination and lots of charm. The playful drawings depict an excited Ruby shouting and pushing to tell everyone her news while imagining herself as a proper young lady wearing frilly gowns in elaborately drawn palace settings. Even the lettering for "The Queen" becomes increasingly ornate as Ruby's anticipation grows. She's not disappointed when her hostess turns out to be Grandma.

The result of this epiphany was the greatest body of mystical poetry the world has ever seen, and the establishment of a spiritual movement that would eventually stretch from Africa to China, enduring to our own day. <br><br>This collection of versions of Rumi by Andrew Harvey contains some of the master's most luminous verse, along with selections from his lesser-read prose works, with the aim of presenting a balanced view of his teaching that includes both the high-flying love of God and the rigorous path of discipline essential for those who seek it.</p><p>Andrew Harvey is the author of&nbsp;<i>Son of Man: The Mystical Path to Christ&nbsp;</i>and more than thirty other books. He has also published several other collections of Rumi, including&nbsp;<i>The Way of Passion.</i><p>YA-A 13th-century Islamic mystic might seem an unlikely figure to be enjoying celebrity in the modern West, but Jelalludin Rumi has been receiving a good deal of attention lately. In his introduction, Harvey explains that "Rumi's work has an uncanny direct force of illumination; anyone approaching it with an open heart and mind, at whatever stage of his or her evolution, will derive from it inspiration, excitement, and help of the highest kind." Working from original sources as well as a variety of translations, he has gleaned from the vast body of Rumi's work an elegantly honed collection of poetry and prose, which he organizes into four sections ("The Call," "Be a Lover," "Ordeal," and "Union"). The result is a guide to the disciplines necessary to achieve, in a continuing process throughout life, an ever-evolving consciousness. As Harvey sees it, Rumi's path to ecstasy requires a "rigorous, even ferocious austerity" that can yield for the seeker a unique perspective on modern problems. For teens venturing outside the lines of religious dogma, this book is a lucid and accessible introduction to Rumi's writings, while for those already somewhat familiar with Rumi through other sources, it offers a challenging method for deeper exploration.-Christine C.

For the first time ever, the most up to date and shocking information from the studies of quantum physics, ufology, and the supernatural are made available to the masses. Even better yet, this information is presented in a way anybody can understand. Learn just how perfectly compatible science and religion can be and why it seems they are always at odds. Uncover what really makes up everything in existence as reality itself is examined at a quantum level. Find out if things like time travel are scientifically and biblically possible. Also discover how, for years, the extraterrestrial hypothesis has dominated the field of ufology. Yet, there is another theory that might provide more substantial answers to the UFO phenomenon. In Unraveling the Multiverse, researcher and author Josh Peck explores the fringe of the extradimensional hypothesis to show the stunning possibility that UFOs and their pilots originate from a higher dimension. Discover answers to paradigm-shifting questions, such as: Is there a way for science and religion to complement one another? Were extradimensional craft and other-worldly beings reported in antiquity? Does quantum physics have any place in the Bible? Who are the mysterious cherubim and what is their role in the affairs of mankind? Do biblical interpretations have any use in explaining scientific observations? Did nonhuman entities leave behind evidence showing their extradimensional nature? Is quantum physics unknowable to religious minds? Are higher dimensions interacting with our own? Must a scientific mind also be void of religion? Are there prophecies pointing to a possible return of extradimensional beings? Do things like strings, branes, multiple dimensions, parallel universes, time warps, quantum entanglement, and extradimensional beings have any place in biblical descriptions of God&#39;s creation?

The recipes (spelled &#34;&#34;receipts&#34;&#34;) it published were often submitted by women from both the North and the South, and they reveal the wide variety of regional cooking that characterized American culture. There is a remarkable diversity in the recipes, thanks to the largely rural readership of Godey&#39;s Lady&#39;s Book and to the immigrant influence on the country in the 1860s. Fish and game were readily available in rural America, and the number of seafood recipes testifies to the abundance of the coastal waters and rivers. The country cook was a frugal cook, particularly during wartime, so there are a great many recipes for leftovers and seasonal produce. In addition to a wide sampling of recipes that can be used today, Civil War Recipes includes information on Union and Confederate army rations, cooking on both homefronts, and substitutions used during the war by southern cooks.</p><p>"A valuable work to all readers who are interested in American cooking practices of the past, especially of the era of the Civil War."&#x2014;Charles P.

For the first time in our home planet's 4.5-billion-year history a single species is increasingly dictating Earth's future.</p><p>To some the Anthropocene symbolizes a future of superlative control of our environment. To others it is the height of hubris, the illusion of our mastery over nature.

Some say it started with the explosion of the first atomic bombs. . . . Others say it is more recent in origin and point to plastics that now cover the planet. . . . Either way, the Anthropocene&#x2019;s origins are viewed as being relatively recent. But Lewis and Maslin disagree.

In this inspiring and accessible guide, best-selling author and popular tutor&nbsp;Terry Harrison shares a wealth of tips and techniques for painting snow in watercolour. Suitable for artists of all abilities, Terry shows you how to capture the beauty of snow-covered landscapes using easy techniques. The book begins with guidance on colour mixes and brushes for achieving different effects, and moves on to step-by-step demonstrations of painting snow-laden trees, frozen streams, wintry skies, falling snow, and the warm glow of a low winter sun. He provides valuable tips on using photographs for reference, and turning a summer landscape into a snow-covered one. There's also a section on how to create a traditional Christmas scene, and how to turn it into a Christmas card. With numerous examples of Terry's beautiful artwork, this book is a truly indispensable guide for anyone wishing to paint snow scenes in watercolour.</p><p>Terry Harrison grew up in Norfolk. His early art education was basic and he never dreamed that he would become an artist. At fifteen, Terry moved to Hampshire and was inspired by a brilliant art teacher. He took O and A levels in art, then won a place at Farnham Art School at the age of sixteen. He became a graphic artist, but continued to paint in his spare time. In 1984 Terry gave up his job to paint full time. He demonstrates to artists&#39; groups and teaches on painting holidays. He has also developed a range of his own brushes and paints. He is the author of many best selling books on painting with acrylics and watercolours. Terry now lives in the Cotswolds. www.terryharrisonart.comNovember 2017 Terry Harrison who sadly died earlier this year, has left a huge legacy to amateur painters though his teaching books and DVDs. Painting Watercolour Snow Scenes the Easy Way is the last book Terry wrote for Search Press and is certain to be every bit successful as those that have gone before. Dealing with that most difficult of subjects, snow, Terry shares his techniques on how to capture it in watercolour using clear and easy-to-follow instruction, and his own collection of brushes specifically designed for beginners to achieve results quickly. Clear images show step-by-step stages in great detail and the booik is packed full of tips and techniques to make the best of your skills, including working from photographs and how to change a summer scene into a winter one. Six projects are included for you to follow. * The Leisure Painter * August 2017 Sadly, this is going to be my last review of a new Terry Harrison book. His death left a huge hole in the world of art instruction and many readers are going to be asking where they will go now. Terry was one of the best explainers and his relaxed style of both painting and demonstrating made his results look, while easy, not too easy. You think, &#39;with a bit of effort, I could do that too&#39; and the real secret is you can. Terry always gave a polished performance but there was never any sleight of hand, no secrets he kept to himself. Follow the instructions, maybe even use his own range of brushes (they really do what they promise) and the results will follow. He many be gone, but there&#39;s a substantial legacy of books and articles that we can refer to for many years to come. This new book was one he most wanted to write. Given his free choice of topic, it was the one he chose and I&#39;ve been told he saw the proofs and was delighted by the result. Snow is one of the hardest things to part, harder even than water, which is all about reflections. Snow looks white, but isn&#39;t. It&#39;s blue, it&#39;s grey and it&#39;s every colour in between. It obscures familiar shapes but creates new ones and has a structure and perspective all of its own. All the techniques are here, along with exercises and demonstrations that cover tracks, trees, mountains, water, buildings and much else. There are even some well wrapped figures and one snowman! Snow is an impermanent thing, but Terry gives it the substance you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s both ironic and typical of him that Terry chose to subtitle this &#39;the easy way&#39;. As we all know, there is no quick or easy way to paint and it&#39;s a private joke between us and the author that there might be. This, though, is Terry saying &#39;trust me&#39; and very gently showing you the way without leading. If it was mountaneering, he&#39;d be holding the rope, but still letting you do the climb. He may be gone, but all the belays are still there. * The Artist *</p><h2>House of Cards (House of Cards, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The <em>USA Today</em> Bestseller from the Executive Producer of the hit Netflix series <em>House of Cards</em>.</strong></p><p>A dark tale of greed, corruption, and unquenchable ambition, <em>House of Cards</em> reveals that no matter the country, politics, intrigue and passion reign in the corridors of power.</p><p><strong>Francis Urquhart has his hand on every secret in politics</strong>-and is willing to betray them all to become prime minister. </p><p><strong>Mattie Storin is a tenacious young reporter</strong> who has a knack for finding the real stories hidden behind the spin.

For a Fellowship is an honor-� and oath-�forged thing, as strong as a bear, as fast as a dragon ship, and as vengeful as the sea. If you betray a Fellowship, you are a dead man, and Ealdorman Ealdred of Wessex had betrayed us.<br><br>With the sail up and the spruce oars stowed, the men looked to their gear. They took whetstones to sword edges, patiently working out the notches carved in battle, and the rhythmic scraping was to me a soothing sound above their murmured conversations and the wet whisper of Serpent&#x2019;s bow through the sea. Men laid mail brynjas across their knees, checking for damaged rings, which they replaced with ones taken from brynjas stripped from the dead. Two of the Norsemen were throwing a heavy-�looking sack back and forth, grunting with the effort. The sack was filled with coarse sand, and if you put your mail in it and threw it around, the sand would clean the rust from the mail and make it like new again. Other men were smearing their brynjas with sheep grease, winding new leather and fine copper wire around sword grips, mending shield straps, and stretching new hides across the limewood planks. Dents were hammered out of helmets, spear blades were honed to wicked points slender enough to skewer a snail from its shell, and ax heads were checked to make sure they would not fly off at the first swing. Silver was weighed, furs were examined, and men argued or grumbled or boasted about the booty they had piled in their journey chests. We combed fleas from our beards and hair, relived fights, exaggerating our deeds and prowess, played tafl, checked Serpent&#x2019;s caulking, and laid leather strips in boots to fix holes. We nursed wounds, exchanged stories about friends now sitting at �din&#x2019;s mead bench in Valh�ll, watched gulls soaring high above, and reveled in the creak of the ship and the low thrum of the rigging. And all the while we believed that Nj�rd, god of the sea, who is kind to those who honor him, filled our sail and that we would soon spy our quarry, Fjord-�Elk, as a speck on the sunlit horizon.<br><br>For we were blessed with a lusty following wind and were making good progress so that the land of the West Saxons was soon little more than a green ribbon on the horizon to the north. If Nj�rd&#x2019;s favor held, Sigurd would sail Serpent through the night to try to shorten the distance between us and Fjord-�Elk, and when we came across her and the treacherous men who sailed her, our swords and our axes would run red.<br><br>Asgot the godi produced a hare from an oiled sack. It was a mangy thing that must have been kicking and scratching furiously ever since we set off, for its fur was sweat-�soaked, its mouth was bloodied, and its eyes were wild with fear. The godi took its head in one old fist, drew his wicked knife, and jabbed it into the animal&#x2019;s chest. Its long feet ran hopelessly in the air. Then Asgot dragged the blade along the hare&#x2019;s belly. Some of its guts fell across Serpent&#x2019;s sheer strake, and still it kicked as though it hoped to dash across a summer meadow. Then he wiped the bloody knife on the hare&#x2019;s fur, sheathed it, and ripped out the rest of the guts&#x2014;�the throbbing heart and the dark twine of the creature&#x2019;s intestines&#x2014;�and threw them into the sea, followed by the carcass itself. We watched for a while as the waves bore the tiny offering away, and then Serpent carried us on and the hare was lost among R�n&#x2019;s daughters. All the while Asgot spoke to the gods, asking them to bless us with fair seas and good weather. Father Egfrith made the sign of the cross to ward off Asgot&#x2019;s old magic, and I believed he was muttering counterspells, though I stayed away, not wanting those Christ words to maggot into my ears.<br><br>It would be a blood-�drenched fight, this one. A real gut ripper. For Ealdorman Ealdred of Wessex and his champion, Mauger, were feckless, snot-�swilling whoresons who had betrayed us all. Ealdred had the holy Gospel book of Saint Jerome, which we had stolen from the king of Mercia, and the toad&#x2019;s arsehole was racing now to sell that Christian treasure to the emperor of the Franks, Charlemagne, or King Karolus as some called him then. The worm would become as rich as a king, having betrayed us and left us for dead. But Ealdred&#x2019;s god and that god&#x2019;s peace-�loving son were not strong enough to make all this happen. They could not save him from us who held to the true gods, the old gods who still shake the sky with thunder and curse the ocean with waves as high as cliffs. And I believed that we would catch the half-�cocked maggot the next day or the day after that, because the English did not know Fjord-�Elk, did not know her ways. For ships are like women&#x2014;�you cannot touch one in the same places as another and hope to get the same ride. But Sigurd knew every inch of Serpent, and his steersman, Knut, knew every grain of salt in every rolling wave. We would catch the En- glish, and then we would kill them.<br><br>&#x201c;These Christians know how to puke, Raven!&#x201d; Bjorn called, the sunlight gleaming across his teeth. &#x201c;The fish will eat well today, I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we shall eat the fish and therefore be eating Christian puke,&#x201d; I said in Norse so that Cynethryth would not understand.<br><br>She and Penda leaned side by side over the sheer strake, emptying their guts into a sea so calm that Bjorn&#x2019;s brother, Bjarni, was bailing Serpent&#x2019;s bilge with all the urgency of a cow on its way to the slaughter. I had seen Serpent flex and writhe like a supple sea creature, so that water continuously seeped in through the seams of her clinkered hull. But not that day. On that day the sea was as calm as a breeze-�stirred lake, yet it was enough to curdle the Saxons&#x2019; stomachs. The Norsemen were grinning and laughing at the two new crewmen, and though I pitied Cynethryth, I was happy it was not me they were laughing at this time, because I had done my share of puking in the early days.<br><br>As for Penda, the Wessexman was as vicious a man as I have ever known, and I had seen him slaughter the Welsh outside Caer Dyffryn so that the green pasture turned blood-�slick. But Penda did not look vicious now with his spew splashing onto the glasslike surface of the sea.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fucking natural to float across the sea on a piece of kindling,&#x201d; Penda said, turning from the ship&#x2019;s side and dragging the back of his hand across his mouth. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not civilized,&#x201d; he growled, and I smiled because Penda was as civilized as a pail full of thunder.<br><br>Sigurd grinned knowingly at me because he knew I had stood in Penda&#x2019;s shoes not so long ago, but though that was true, I would never have referred to Serpent as &#x201c;kindling.&#x201d; I had always appreciated her workmanship, because I had been apprenticed to old Ealhstan the carpenter, and so I knew woodcraft when I saw it. Serpent was a beauty. Seventy-�six feet in length, seventeen feet in the beam, and made from more than two hundred oak trees, she originally could accommodate sixteen oarsmen on either side, but Sigurd had built raised fighting platforms at bow and stern, meaning that now there was space for only thirteen rowers on each side. With our crew of thirty-two men and one woman, it was to my mind a little cramped but not uncomfortable. Olaf told me that on one of Sigurd&#x2019;s expeditions, when Serpent was newly built and before he had Fjord-�Elk, she had carried a double crew of seventy warriors, one crew resting while the other rowed. That surely must have been a useful thing when it came to a fight, but I could not imagine sharing sleeping space with so many fart-stinking men. The ship had a small open hold for trade goods and supplies and a sturdy mast step and keel. She was fourteen strakes high and had a great square sail of wool that had been dyed red, and at her bow stood the head of J�rmungand, the Midgard-Serpent that encircles the earth. That beast&#x2019;s faded red eyes stared out across the gray sea into our futures. Every Norseman aboard, every warrior sitting on the sea chest containing his possessions, respected Serpent as he respected his mother, loved her as he loved his wife, and relished her as he relished his whores.<br><br>Cynethryth turned around, palming sweat from her forehead, and I swear her face was as green as a new fern. She caught my eye and seemed embarrassed, and so I looked away, pointing out to Black Floki a length of tarred rope caulking that was working itself free of two of the strakes beside him. The Norseman grunted and with a gnarled thumb began to press the thin rope back in. Once I had thought Floki hated me, but we had since grown close, as sword-�brothers do. Today, though, it seemed he was back to his miserable, brooding self.<br><br>Father Egfrith, as far as I could tell, suffered no ill effects from Serpent&#x2019;s motion, and maybe that had something to do with Glum&#x2019;s having cracked open his head with a sword blow. Somehow the little monk had survived. Worse than that, he had chosen to come aboard&#x2014;�an odd path for a monk, to board a ship full of heathens&#x2014;�and maybe that had something to do with the sword blow, too. He was a sniffling little m�rd, a weasel, but in a strange way I admired him because he must have known that any of us could squash him like a louse if he gave us reason or merely for want of something else to do. Truly, the Christ slave believed he would turn Serpent into a ship full of Christians, just as he boasted that his god had turned water into wine. Though if you ask me, turning Norsemen into Christians would be more like changing wine into piss. Perhaps he even hoped to change Serpent&#x2019;s name to Holy Spirit or The Jerusalem or Christ&#x2019;s Hairy Left Ball or who knows what? Egfrith was a fool.<br><br>By the time the day&#x2019;s heat had been chased away by a cold breeze whipping off the sea and the gold disk of the sun had rolled into the west, we had yet to set eyes on Fjord-�Elk. At Serpent&#x2019;s prow J�rmungand nodded gently, its faded red eyes staring seaward, tirelessly searching for its sister ship. I almost believed the snarling figurehead would give a roar of triumph if Fjord-�Elk came into sight.<br><br>&#x201c;I am thinking that the crawling piece of pig&#x2019;s dung might have set a more easterly course than our own,&#x201d; Olaf said, dipping a cup into the rain barrel and slurping. He stood by Knut, who gripped the tiller with the familiarity of a man holding his wife&#x2019;s hand. Sigurd was behind and above them, standing on the fighting platform, looking out as the sun, which was plunging toward the world&#x2019;s rim, washed his long fair hair with golden light.<br><br>&#x201c;You think he&#x2019;s that shrewd?&#x201d; Knut asked, hawking and spitting a gob of phlegm over Serpent&#x2019;s side. Olaf shrugged.<br><br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s got the sense,&#x201d; Sigurd said, &#x201c;to take the shortest crossing and then head south within spitting distance of the coast rather than crossing the open sea as we have done. Then he will enter the mouth of the Sicauna, that great river that eats into the heart of Frankia.&#x201d; Olaf raised one bushy eyebrow skeptically, but I thought Sigurd was probably right. As a Christian lord, Ealdorman Ealdred would have less to fear from Frankish ships patrolling the coast than we as pagans would. He also would have more to fear from open water than we did, for even though the sailing conditions were perfect now, a sudden change in the weather or an irreparable leak could make a man wish he had stayed in sight of land. And Ealdred did not know Fjord-�Elk.<br><br>A quizzical look nestled itself in Olaf&#x2019;s bushy beard like a dog settling in a pile of straw. &#x201c;So that English arse leaf is sucking the coast like it&#x2019;s his mother&#x2019;s tit,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve not had so much as a sniff of him.&#x201d;<br><br>Sigurd pursed his lips, scratched his golden beard, but did not reply. He looked up at the square sail, studying the way the wind moved across it, rippling the cloth. He watched the dance of the thick sheet ropes and the direction of the waves, and then he looked toward the sun. It was low, and so it gave him a reliable east&#x2013;�west bearing. His thick lips curled like a wolf&#x2019;s just before the teeth are bared, because if he was right and Ealdred had crossed the shortest stretch of sea, putting him farther north along the Frankish coastline, then all we had to do when we came to the coast was choose a mooring with a good view of the open channel. And wait.<br><br>With dusk came land. Frankia. I knew nothing of Frankia then, but even so the word was a heavy one. It was a word that meant power, a word that carried with it, at least to pagan ears, the threat of sharpened steel and hateful warriors and the new, ravenously hungry magic&#x2014;�the magic of the White Christ. For the king of the Franks was Karolus, lord of Christendom. Emperor they called him, as the Romans had named their kings who ruled lands as far and wide as the skies above. And despite his fealty to the nailed god, men said this Emperor Karolus was the greatest warrior in the entire world.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you smell that?&#x201d; Father Egfrith called. He was standing at Serpent&#x2019;s prow, being careful not to touch the carved beast head of J�rmungand. Perhaps he feared it had a taste for Christians. &#x201c;You can smell the piety!&#x201d; he called, sniffing eagerly, crinkling his weasel-�like face in pleasure. The coast loomed ahead, a low green line broken by gray rock. &#x201c;The Franks are a God-�fearing people, and their king is a light in the darkness. He is the cleansing fire that guides men from iniquity, like a beacon, a great wind-�whipped flame which saves ships from splintering against the rocks,&#x201d; he said, taking altogether too much pleasure in the comparison. &#x201c;If we are lucky, Raven, we will meet the great king, and because God loves him and because Karolus is said to be a generous and gracious king, maybe you will be given the chance to wash your black soul. Scrape the sin from it like fat from a calf&#x2019;s skin. Christ the Almighty will drag Satan out of your blood-�filled eye by his gnarly ankle.&#x201d; The m�rd was grinning, and I wondered what it would feel like to put that grin through the back of his head. But then I smiled, because although Egfrith thought I was the spawn of Satan, worthless as snail slime, there was something about him that I had come to like. No, not like. Rather, the little man amused me.<br><br>&#x201c;Your god had better have strong arms, monk,&#x201d; I said, encompassing Serpent&#x2019;s Norse crew with a sweep of my arm, &#x201c;if he is to yank the Devil from us all. Perhaps he will find Satan hiding in Bram&#x2019;s armpit or skulking up Svein&#x2019;s arse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sin has no refuge, young man,&#x201d; Egfrith chided as Serpent reared a rogue wave, causing him to unbalance and stumble, though he somehow kept his feet without reaching for J�rmungand. &#x201c;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our lord!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the little man creaking on about, Raven?&#x201d; Svein the Red asked, turning to me, his massive head cocked to one side. He was tugging a new ivory comb though his thick red hair, and I guessed he already had forgotten about his old one with the missing teeth. Svein was the biggest man I had ever seen, a fearsome warrior of few words, and he was watching Father Egfrith the way a battle-�scarred hound watches a playful pup.<br><br>&#x201c;He says his god wants to look for Satan up your arse,&#x201d; I said in Norse. &#x201c;I told him you might enjoy that.&#x201d; The others laughed, but Svein frowned, his hairy red brows meeting above his bulbous nose.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell him that he and his god are welcome to anything that comes out of my arse,&#x201d; he said, rousing more &#x201c;hey&#x201d;s. Then he lifted his right buttock and farted, and R�n must have heard it at the bottom of the sea. &#x201c;There you go, Christ slave,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come and get it while it&#x2019;s warm.&#x201d;</p><h2>Wintering: A Novel</h2><p><b>A true epic: a love story that spans sixty years, generations&#x2019; worth of feuds, and secrets withheld and revealed. </b><br><br>One day, elderly, demented Harry Eide steps out of his sickbed and disappears into the brutal, unforgiving Minnesota wilderness that surrounds his hometown of Gunflint. It's not the first time Harry has vanished. Thirty-odd years earlier, in 1963, he'd fled his marriage with his eighteen-year-old-son Gustav in tow. He'd promised Gustav a rambunctious adventure, two men taking on the woods in winter.&nbsp;<br><br>With Harry gone for the second (and last) time, unable to survive the woods he'd once braved, his son Gus, now grown, sets out to relate the story of their first disappearance--bears and ice floes and all--to Berit Lovig, an old woman who shares a special, if turbulent, bond with Harry. <i>Wintering</i> is a thrilling adventure story wrapped in the deep, dark history of a rural town.</p><p><b>PETER GEYE</b>&nbsp;was born and raised in Minneapolis, where he continues to live. His previous novels are <i>Safe from the Sea</i> and <i>The Lighthouse Road</i>.Our winters are faithful and unfailing and we take what they bring, but this season has tested even the most devout among us. The thermometer hanging outside my window reads thirty-�two degrees below zero. Five degrees warmer than yesterday, which itself was warmer than the day before. I can hear the pines exploding, heartwood turned to splinter and pulp all up and down the Burnt Wood River.<br><br>As if the cold weren&#x2019;t enough, yesterday brought another unkindness. Gustav Eide came bearing it: his father&#x2019;s red woolen hat&#x2014;�the one he wore almost every day, the type children wear tobogganing&#x2014;�found by those Bargaard twins as they ice-�skated out past the breakwater.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time Gus came knocking this winter. Back in November he held his own hat in his hands. Gus, with his father&#x2019;s lonesome, lazy eyes, standing bareheaded but buttoned up outside my door.<br><br>&#x201c;I hate to drop in unannounced, Berit,&#x201d; he had said then.<br><br>&#x201c;Since when do we stand on ceremony around here? Come in.&#x201d;<br><br>He stepped inside but stood with his back against the door, his eyes studying his bootlaces. I&#x2019;ve seen much of this town&#x2019;s woe, its suffering and tragedy, and have marked it all. While I stood there waiting for Gus to speak, I knew my own everlasting sadness was suddenly upon me.<br><br>&#x201c;He disappeared last night, Berit.&#x201d; He spoke without looking up. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>I turned and stepped carefully to the bench under the window and sat.<br><br>&#x201c;We found tracks heading up the river,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I looked up at him, now looking down at me. I thought of sitting at his father&#x2019;s bedside the evening before, holding his hand, singing to him. I thought of how Harry had looked at me, his gaze seeming to go through me and into some past only he could see. I was disappearing from his view. This I knew.<br><br>Gus came and sat next to me on the bench. &#x201c;That new sheriff&#x2014;�Ruutu&#x2019;s his name&#x2014;�is leading the search. We went all the way up past the lower falls. The dogs lost his scent around the Devil&#x2019;s Maw. Ruutu&#x2019;s down in Gunflint right now, calling for more help.&#x201d;<br><br>He reached over and held my hand, a gesture he surely learned from his father and one that calmed me down, at once familiar and uncanny. There are depths to those Eides no sounding line will ever reach. I knew this about Harry and I have come to know it about Gus, though on that November morning he knew me much better than I did him.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not going to find him, Berit.&#x201d;<br><br>He let my hand go and sat back and rubbed the cold from his cheeks.<br><br>&#x201c;Why would you say that? He can&#x2019;t have gone far,&#x201d; I said, thinking again of that faraway look in Harry&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve heard this story before, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Speak plainly, would you? For the benefit of an old lady?&#x201d;<br><br>Then Gus looked through me just as his father had only hours before. &#x201c;People searched for don&#x2019;t get found here. Not in these woods.&#x201d; He closed his eyes and shook his head as though to banish some thought. &#x201c;Put on some coffee? I&#x2019;ll tell you how all this happened.&#x201d;<br><br>So I did. I went to the kitchen and filled the kettle at the sink. As the water poured from the faucet I glanced upriver, where I have kept my eyes more or less since. Two stories began that day in November. One of them was new and the other as old as this land itself. Both of them were borne by the river.<br><br>Ruutu and his deputies and Gus and his sister, Signe, and the good people of Gunflint spent a week searching for Harry, every dawn following some new dead end into the wilderness, every dusk emerging from wherever they&#x2019;d been, tired and cold and no closer to finding him. Gus stopped by each evening to tell me where they&#x2019;d looked, assuring me every single time they&#x2019;d never find him. Even still, the next morning he went out with the others. Sometimes three or four parties, following three or four leads. When, finally, they conceded Harry to the wilderness, it was thanks to Gus&#x2019;s insistence. Signe went back home to Minneapolis. Gus back to his job teaching English and history at Arrowhead High School. Ruutu back to our local misdemeanors and traffic violations.<br><br>Me? I was still searching in my own fashion. That first morning, I visited Harry&#x2019;s empty bed. There was the iron headboard and the flannel linens and the quilt crumpled at the foot of the bed. Harry was always too warm. The pillow still held the imprint of his head. His medication sat on the bedside table, next to the radio and a half-�drunk glass of water. The bureau opposite the bedside table was as old and timeworn as whatever part of Harry stored his memories. I crossed the room and opened the top drawer and noticed straightaway his knit hat was missing. Strangely, the pompom had been snipped off.<br><br>I&#x2019;d passed the previous evening as I had so many others before it, sitting at his bedside, reminding him of who we used to be, feeling at times that I was not only disappearing into the darkness of his mind but from the world altogether. It was no less strange that evening than it had been at the start of his confinement to see a man still so bodily strong becoming a child again. No less strange and no less unbearable.<br><br>Of that last night we spent together, I cannot say he exhibited any signs he was about to undertake a disappearance, no word spoken or gesture made that gave me pause. He did nothing that might&#x2019;ve forewarned me. That evening I only hoped, as I did every night, that when he finally fell to sleep he would do so with the knowledge of my love, and that when he dreamt it would be of peaceful things.<br><br>It was Doctor Ingebrigsten&#x2014;�who grew up in Misquah, went to medical school in Minneapolis, and returned to Arrowhead County because, she said, this place needed one of its own to care for its sickly&#x2014;�who described to Gus and me what it would become like for Harry. &#x201c;You and I,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;we see our past as though it were a bright summer day. The trees green, flowers blossoming, the water shining blue. Harry&#x2019;s going to start seeing less and less of his past until&#x2014;�sadly&#x2014;�everything will seem as though it&#x2019;s taking place in a nighttime blizzard in the dead of winter.&#x201d; She said this on a September morning, with the trees in full autumn blaze&#x2014;�our loveliest time of year&#x2014;�and I wept to think that the man I loved would never register that beauty again, even if he lived another ten years.<br><br>That same morning Doctor Ingebrigsten told me the best thing I could do for Harry was to be with him.

Why are societies so deeply divided? What happened to the many advanced cultures that preceded ours? Are there sentient beings visiting us from other planets, and if so, why haven't they made themselves known? Is there a God like the one we've been taught to believe in? And how far might spirituality take us, or does science hold the key to progress? We all ask questions like these not even expecting answers--but what if answers existed? Would we recognize the truth once uncovered?<br><br>Enter Frank: a collective of eight beings from a distant planet who know what we're going through because they've been there too. Their civilization, once beset by many of the same challenges we face, has now advanced to a point where they can offer an informed and compassionate perspective on our trials, tribulations, and triumphs here on Earth. Speaking to Mike Dooley, one of today's most celebrated New Thought leaders, with medium Tracy Farquhar serving as their channel, Frank answers questions about:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Life on Brahoshka, from culture, technology, and education to leisure pursuits, food supply, relationships...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing earthly matters, from our political and social realities to the truth behind the Loch Ness Monster <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of imagination, meditation, concentrated thought, divination, and prayer<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth concerning angels, other dimensions, and what we can do to make a better world&lt;</p><p><b>Mike Dooley</b> is a former PriceWaterhouseCoopers international tax consultant turned entrepreneur.

But you have nothing to write about. All the other kids seem to have something to tell because they start in right away. What can you do? Stop and think. No one else can tell <i>your</i> stories -- about your family, your dog or cat. No one else can tell how it was when your library book got soaked in the rain. <br> But what if you don't like what you write? There are all sorts of ways to change it, to make it better. Keep on playing with your words, putting them together in different ways. You want whatever you write to be good. It will get better and better as you work on it. <br> This is an encouraging book, sympathetically illustrated by Teresa Flavin's charming pictures, for all young readers who worry when they're told to write something.</p><p><b>Janet S.

Janet lives with her family in Medina, Washington.Grade 3-5-This book's gentle but direct approach to creative writing may not appeal to all youngsters, but it may help some students to address some common struggles and to find their own voices. Through free-verse poetry, Wong targets a group of youngsters looking for good topics for a writing assignment. "You want it to be good, to make us cry or bust up laughing when the room is quiet." They are encouraged to look around, and not to be discouraged by the worldliness or experiences of others. "Wait. Did you forget who you are? Who else can say what you have seen? Who else can tell your stories-." A photo albumlike page shows a variety of pets, holidays, hobbies, vacations, and family outings that could be possible topics. "Reach inside. Write about the dark times. -Write about the bright times. -Take your mind for a walk back to this morning, back to yesterday-." Examples are given of parents fighting, a wet library book growing mildew, childhood fears of storms, and taking out the trash. For "Weave them together- half of Draft 1, a word from Draft 4, a whole line from number 5. Try. Because you have to write, and you want it to be good," the illustration shows each child laying out stretches of many drafts on the floor. The simple realistic gouache paintings are rather ordinary but appropriate for the "writing from life" philosophy that is espoused.<br><i>Adele Greenlee, Bethel College, St. Paul, MN </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Beast Meridian</h2><p>Poetry. Latino/Latina Studies. LGBTQIA Studies. Women's Studies. BEAST MERIDIAN narrates the first- generation Mexican American girl, tracking the experiences of cultural displacement, the inheritance of generational trauma, sexist and racist violence, sexual assault, economic struggle, and institutional racism and sexism that disproportionately punishes brown girls in crisis. Narrated by a speaker in mourning marked as an at- risk juvenile, psychologically troubled, an offender, expelled and sent to alternative school for adolescents with behavioral issues, and eventually, a psychiatric hospital, it survives the school to prison pipeline, the immigrant working class condition, grueling low- pay service jobs, conservative classism against Latinxs in Texas, queerness, assimilation, and life wrapped up in frivolous citations, fines, and penalties. The traumatic catalyst for the long line of trouble begins with the death of a beloved young grandmother from preventable cervical cancer&#x2014;another violence of systemic racism and sexism that prevents regular reproductive and sexual health care to poor immigrant communities&#x2014;and the subsequent deaths of other immigrant family members who are mourned in the dissociative states amidst the depressive trauma that opens the book. The dissociative states that mark the middle&#x2014;a surreal kind of shadowland where the narrator encounters her animal self and ancestors imagined as animals faces brutal surreal challenges on the way back to life beyond trauma&#x2014;is a kind of mictlan, reimagined as a state of constant mourning that challenges American notions of "healing" from trauma, and rather acknowledges sadness, mourning, and memory as a necessary state of constant awareness to forge a "way back" toward a broader healing of earth, time, body, history.</p><p>Vanessa Ang�lica Villarreal was born in the Rio Grande Valley borderlands to formerly undocumented Mexican immigrants.

Our knowledge about the world is constructed in language-the worlds of home and the community, the worlds of school subjects, the worlds of literature, the worlds of the workplace, and so on. It is through language that we interact with others and build our identities. Teachers' explanations, classroom discussions, assessment of student achievement, and students' understanding, composition, and evaluation of texts are all mediated through language.

It c- tains, however, a number of deeper messages related to some of the most basic and important principles of modern biology. Te bees are merely the actors that take us into the realm of phys- ology, genetics, reproduction, biophysics and learning, and that introduce us to the principles of natural selection underlying the evolution of simple to complex life forms. Te book destroys the cute notion of bees as anthropomorphic icons of busy self-sacr -i fcing individuals and presents us with the reality of the colony as an integrated and independent being&#x2015;a &#x201c;superorganism&#x201d;&#x2015;with its own, almost eerie, emergent group intelligence. We are s- prised to learn that no single bee, from queen through drone to sterile worker, has the oversight or control over the colony. - stead, through a network of integrated control systems and fee- backs, and communication between individuals, the colony - rives at consensus decisions from the bottom up through a type of &#x201c;swarm intelligence&#x201d;. Indeed, there are remarkable parallels between the functional organization of a swarming honeybee colony and vertebrate brains.</p><p><p>&#x201c;Whereas bee colonies were once seen as perfect societies of selfless workers and drones ruled by a queen, Tautz presents them as a self-organized, complex adaptive system that he considers &#x201c;a mammal in many bodies&#x201d;. This comprehensive introduction to honeybee biology (originally published as <em>Ph�nomen Honigbiene</em>) explores such topics as how bees obtain and communicate information about flowers, &#x201c;whole-animal gametes&#x201d;, and the comb&#x2019;s contributions to the sociophysiology of the colony. The author has been honored for making research accessible to the public, and his lucid text will reward lay readers, apiarists, students, and professional biologists alike. The book is profusely illustrated with Heilmann&#x2019;s spectacular photos, which capture the full range of bee activities&#x2015;including some, such as the living chains formed where combs are being built or repaired, whose function remains unknown.&#x201d; (SCIENCE, Vol. 322, 19 December 2008)</p> <p>&#x201c;With spectacularly beautiful colour photographs and an easy understandable text <em>The Buzz about Bees</em> tells the story of honeybees in a new perspective. Based on the latest data, notably from his own research group, J�rgen Tautz provides a wonderful insight into the realms of bees. In contrast to the view of bee colonies as perfect societies of selfless individuals ruled by a queen, Tautz introduces them as a &#x201c;superorganism&#x201d;, a self organizing and complex adaptive system based on a network of communication; a fascinating result of evolution &#x2013; a mammal in several bodies. The entire range of astonishing bee activities is described. Remarkable action photographs never shown before present bees busy with cell cleaning, caring for the brood, serving in the queen&#x2019;s court, visiting flowers, receiving nectar, producing honey, comb building, entrance guarding, heating and cooling.

It has become a new tool for modeling in biology, geology, and other natural sciences. <br><br>Anthropologists have observed that the patterns produced in different cultures can be characterized by specific design themes. In Europe and America, we often see cities laid out in a grid pattern of straight streets and right-angle corners. In contrast, traditional African settlements tend to use fractal structures-circles of circles of circular dwellings, rectangular walls enclosing ever-smaller rectangles, and streets in which broad avenues branch down to tiny footpaths with striking geometric repetition. These indigenous fractals are not limited to architecture; their recursive patterns echo throughout many disparate African designs and knowledge systems. <br><br>Drawing on interviews with African designers, artists, and scientists, Ron Eglash investigates fractals in African architecture, traditional hairstyling, textiles, sculpture, painting, carving, metalwork, religion, games, practical craft, quantitative techniques, and symbolic systems. He also examines the political and social implications of the existence of African fractal geometry. His book makes a unique contribution to the study of mathematics, African culture, anthropology, and computer simulations.</p><p>Ron Eglash recieved a bachelor of science degree in cybernetics and his master of science in systems engineering, and he worked at National Semiconductor as a human factors engineer. He returned to the University of California for a doctorate on the cultural analysis of science and technology from the Board of Studies in History in Conciousness, and after graduating recieved a Fulbright scholarship for research in ethnomathematics at the University of Dakar in Senegal. He is currently an assistant professor at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute.&nbsp;</p><h2>Environmental Ethics: The Big Questions</h2><p>Through a series of multidisciplinary readings, <i>Environmental Ethics: The Big Questions</i> contextualizes environmental ethics within the history of Western intellectual tradition and traces the development of theory since the 1970s. <ul> <li>Includes an extended introduction that provides an historical and thematic introduction to the field of environmental ethics</li> <li>Features a selection of brief original essays on why to study environmental ethics by leaders in the field</li> <li>Contextualizes environmental ethics within the history of the Western intellectual tradition by exploring anthropocentric (human-centered) and nonanthropocentric precedents</li> <li>Offers an interdisciplinary approach to the field by featuring seminal work from eminent philosophers, biologists, ecologists, historians, economists, sociologists, anthropologists, nature writers, business writers, and others</li> <li>Designed to be used with a web-site which contains a continuously updated archive of case studies: <p>http://environmentalethics.info/</p> &nbsp;</li> </ul></p><p>Environmental ethics is a relatively new philosophical discipline that addresses the complex convergence of humans with the natural world and its nonhuman inhabitants. <i>Environmental Ethics: The Big Questions</i> presents a series of interdisciplinary readings that examine the moral dimensions of the delicate relationship between human beings and the environment.

He was already germinating a secularist challenge to religion that would be as radical as it was original. He went on to produce one of the most ambitious systems in the history of Western philosophy, so ahead of its time that scientists today, from string theorists to neurobiologists, count themselves among Spinoza&#x2019;s progeny.<br><br>In <i>Betraying Spinoza,</i> Rebecca Goldstein sets out to rediscover the flesh-and-blood man often hidden beneath the veneer of rigorous rationality, and to crack the mystery of the breach between the philosopher and his Jewish past. Goldstein argues that the trauma of the Inquisition&#x2019; s persecution of its forced Jewish converts plays itself out in Spinoza&#x2019;s philosophy. The excommunicated Spinoza, no less than his excommunicators, was responding to Europe&#x2019; s first experiment with racial anti-Semitism.<br><br>Here is a Spinoza both hauntingly emblematic and deeply human, both heretic and hero&#x2014;a surprisingly contemporary figure ripe for our own uncertain age.</p><p><b>REBECCA NEWBERGER GOLDSTEIN</b>received her doctorate in philosophy from Princeton University.

Can he even be considered a Jew? Benedictus Spinoza is the greatest philosopher that the Jews ever produced, which adds a certain irony to his questionable Jewishness.<br><br> He was excommunicated at the age of twenty-three by the Portuguese-Jewish community in which he had been raised and educated. It was a community of refugees from the Spanish-Portuguese Inquisition, a Jewish calamity whose tragic proportions would be exceeded only in the twentieth century. The members of the community were predominantly former Marranos, who had lived on the Iberian Peninsula, mostly in Portugal, as practicing Christians since Judaism had been formally outlawed on the peninsula at the end of the fifteenth century. The word marrano is believed to derive from the old Castilian for &#x201c;swine,&#x201d; a particularly apt slur to insult those believed to be concealing Jewish practice beneath Christian performance. The relatively liberal city of Amsterdam provided the conditions for their reconnecting to a Judaism that most of them barely knew. Brutal forces of history had given this community its distinctive tone: ambitious for the material trappings of middle-class stability and yet skittish, anxious; enviably accomplished and cosmopolitan and yet filled with religious intensity, confusion, disillusion, and messianic yearning.<br><br> Before his expulsion from it, the hothouse world of Amsterdam&#x2019;s Sephardim&#x2014;as Jews who derived from Spain (Sepharad in Hebrew) continue to be called to this day&#x2014;had been Spinoza&#x2019;s world as well. Yet when it closed its doors to him, he made no attempt to reenter it or any other Jewish community.<br><br> Excommunication, as it was practiced in his community, was not as severe and final a punishment as the word now suggests. The period of isolation from the community (the terms of excommunication did not extend outside of Amsterdam) typically lasted anywhere from a day to several years. The imposed banishment was a tool of chastisement resorted to with quite common frequency, fundamentally a form of public embarrassment with which to exert control over the volatile mix contained within &#x201c;the Portuguese Nation,&#x201d; as the Amsterdam Sephardim continued to identify themselves.<br><br> Whereas others among the chastised had obediently&#x2014;and sometimes desperately&#x2014;sought reconciliation, Spinoza calmly removed himself from any further form of Jewish life. Nor did Spinoza seek out another religion. In particular, he did not convert to Christianity, though it would have been convenient for him to do so. Spinoza opted for secularism at a time when the concept had not yet been formulated.<br><br> He supported himself by grinding lenses, which was no lowly menial occupation, as it is often presented to have been in romanticizing versions of the philosopher&#x2019;s life, but was rather a craft that drew extensively from Spinoza&#x2019;s serious interest in the science of optics. The quality of his wares was highly valued by other scientists of his day. The important Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, who discovered Saturn&#x2019;s rings as well as one of its four moons, preferred Spinoza&#x2019;s lenses to all others. &#x201c;The [lenses] that the Jew of Voorburg has in his microscopes have an admirable polish,&#x201d; Huygens wrote to his brother in 1667. The one part of the romantic lens-grinding legend that is sadly true is that the dust from the optical polishing was unhealthy for Spinoza, whose mother and brother had both died young from tuberculosis. He himself succumbed to the disease at the age of forty-four.<br><br> Spinoza&#x2019;s personal life was, as he wished it to be, simple and relatively isolated. There was a small circle of devoted friends, freethinking Christians from various dissenting Protestant circles, who regarded Spinoza as their master and closely studied, and guarded, his thoughts. He combined a Marranoist cautious discretion about revealing his true views to the dangerously narrow-minded with a touching faith in the power of reason to persuade. So he published his Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (The Treatise on Theology and Politics) anonymously, but also hoped that it would convince the powers that be of its main conclusion, which is succinctly stated in the book&#x2019;s subtitle: Wherein is set forth that freedom of thought and speech not only may, without prejudice to piety and the public peace, be granted; but also may not, without danger to piety and the public peace, be withheld. The book evolves into one of the most impassioned defenses of a free democratic state in the history of political theory, an eloquent plea for the separation of church and state. Spinoza allowed himself to hope that, should its argument for tolerance find its mark, he might be able to publish the work on which he had been toiling for years. The rain of abuse that poured down on the author of the Tractatus, whose true identity was soon an open secret throughout Europe, made him a very dangerous man to even remotely acknowledge, and all but foreclosed the possibility of his publishing his magnum opus in his lifetime. This is The Ethics, a work that makes all the claims for reason that have ever been made.<br><br> Some favors came his way. The University of Heidelberg, which had fallen from its perch of previous glory through the prolonged tribulations of the Thirty Years&#x2019; War, had no professor of philosophy on staff and, in the name of Karl Ludwig, Elector Palatine, offered him a chair of philosophy. &#x201c;You will not find elsewhere a Prince more favorably disposed to men of exceptional genius, among whom he ranks you. You will have the most extensive freedom in philosophizing, which he believes you will not misuse to disturb the publicly established religion.&#x201d; The philosopher delicately declined: &#x201c;If I had ever had any desire to undertake a professorship in any faculty, I could have wished for none other than that which is offered me through you by the Serene Highness the Elector Palatine, especially on account of the freedom to philosophize that this most gracious Prince is pleased to grant, not to mention my long-felt wish to live under the rule of a Prince whose wisdom is universally admired.&#x201d; But his instinct for caution had been alerted by the ambiguity of the terms of the offered freedom. &#x201c;I do not know within what limits the freedom to philosophize must be confined if I am to avoid appearing to disturb the publicly established religion. . . . So you see, most Honorable Sir, that my reluctance is not due to the hope of some better fortune, but to my love of peace, which I believe I can enjoy in some measure if I refrain from lecturing in public.&#x201d;<br><br> Some important intellectual figures of the day made their way to the modest rooms he rented in the Hague in his last years, including the up-and-coming young go-getter Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who would emerge as one of the most dazzling figures in the seventeenth century&#x2019;s impressive lineup of genius. Leibniz spent a few days with Spinoza, conversing on metaphysics. The only written record of their extensive conversations was a slip of paper on which Leibniz had written down, for Spinoza&#x2019;s approval, a proof for God&#x2019;s existence. Leibniz was profoundly influenced by Spinoza&#x2019;s ideas but sought always to conceal his philosophical debt, and is on record as denouncing the philosopher. When a professor of rhetoric at the University of Utrecht, one Johan Georg Graevius, wrote to Leibniz, castigating the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus as a &#x201c;most pestilential book,&#x201d; whose author &#x201c;is said to be a Jew named Spinoza, but who was cast out of the synagogue because of his monstrous opinions,&#x201d; Leibniz prudently chimed in with his own diplomatic calumny: &#x201c;I have read the book by Spinoza. I am saddened by the fact that such a learned man has, as it seems, sunk so low.&#x201d;<br><br> Spinoza remained throughout his life, and well into the eighteenth century, a thinker whom one could admire only in secret, hiding one&#x2019;s sympathy just as his Marrano antecedents had concealed their wayward Jewishness. Open admiration could destroy even the most established of reputations, well into the eighteenth century&#x2019;s so-called Age of Reason. In the 1780s, for example, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi launched a generalized attack on Enlightenment thought by claiming that the late poet Lessing had been a closet Spinozist, a charge sufficient to compromise the entire movement for which Lessing had been a leading spokesman. Jacobi even went after Immanuel Kant and his successors, arguing that &#x201c;consistent philosophy is Spinozist, hence pantheist, fatalist, and atheist.&#x201d;<br><br> The holy furor aroused by the name Spinoza is in contrast to the man&#x2019;s predilection for peace and quiet. He confessed himself to have a horror of controversy. &#x201c;I absolutely dread quarrels,&#x201d; he wrote an acquaintance, explaining why he had declined to publish a work that contains some of the main themes of The Ethics, titled Short Treatise on God, Man, and His Well-Being. The signet ring he wore throughout his life was inscribed with the word caute, Latin for &#x201c;cautiously,&#x201d; and it was engraved with the image of a thorny rose, so that he signed his name sub rosa. One might argue that the very form of The Ethics, written in the highly formalized &#x201c;geometrical style&#x201d; inspired by Euclid&#x2019;s Elements, is partially designed for the practical purpose of keeping out any but the most gifted of readers, rigorously cerebral and patiently rational.<br><br> Spinoza&#x2019;s ambitions on behalf of reason are staggering: he aims to give us a rigorously proved view of reality, which view will yield us, if only we will assimilate it, a life worth living. It will transform our emotional substance, our very selves. The truth shall set us free. His methodology for exposing the nature of reality was inspired by one of the strands that the seventeenth century&#x2019;s men of science were weaving into what we now refer to as the scientific method, that magnificently subtle, supple, and successful blend of mathematical deduction and empirical induction. Spinoza was keenly interested, and involved in the intellectual innovations that we now look back on as constituting the birth of modern science. His inspiration came from the mathematical component of modern science, not its empiricism. The methodology he believed could reveal it all was strictly deductive, which is not the way that science ultimately went. (Still, there are contemporary physicists and cosmologists who are inspired by the Spinozist ideal of &#x201c;a theory of everything,&#x201d; one in which the mathematics alone would determine its truth. String theorists, in particular, pursue physics almost entirely as a deductive endeavor, letting their mathematics prevail over niggling empirical questions. The spirit motivating them is Spinozism, which sometimes makes other scientists question whether what string theorists are up to really qualifies as science at all.)<br><br> But if the claims Spinoza makes on behalf of pure reason can strike us as staggering, there are also, staggeringly, a number of propositions that he produced from out of his deductive system that have been, centuries later, scientifically vindicated. A leading neurobiologist, Antonio Damasio, argues in his Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain that Spinoza&#x2019;s view of the relationship between mind and brain, as well as the complicated theory of the emotions that he deduced from it, are precisely what the latest empirical findings support. Spinoza, despite his nonempiricist methodology, is not scientifically irrelevant.<br><br> But there are claims that come out of Spinoza&#x2019;s deductive system that are even more important for our times, more piercingly relevant, than his happening to have produced a stunningly contemporary answer, through pure deductive reason, to the mind-body problem and given us a view of the emotions that science has caught up with, in thinkers like Damasio, after some three hundred years. What Spinoza has to say about the importance of allowing the discovery of nature to proceed unimpeded by religious dogma could not speak more pertinently to some of the raging controversies of our day, including the recurring public debate in America over Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution. The sides are drawn up now much as they were in Spinoza&#x2019;s own day.<br><br> Just as relevant to current concerns, particularly in America, is his fundamental insistence on the separation of church and state. John Locke, who spent some years in Amsterdam, right after Spinoza&#x2019;s death, associating with thinkers who had known and been influenced by Spinoza, transmitted this insistence to the founding fathers of America. The spirit of Spinoza lives on in the opening words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the phrase referred to as the Establishment clause: &#x201c;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#x201d;<br><br> Spinoza placed all his faith in the powers of reason, his own and ours. He enjoins us to join him in the religion of reason, and promises us some of the same benefits&#x2014;while firmly denying us others&#x2014;that traditional religions promise. Rigorous reason will lead us to a state of mind that is the height of what we can achieve not only intellectually but also, in a sense&#x2014;the only sense compatible with his rationalism&#x2014;spiritually. The aim of his ethics is to give us the means to arrive at a &#x201c;contentment of spirit, which arises out of the . . . knowledge of God.&#x201d; This is the state of mind dubbed &#x201c;blessedness&#x201d; by the man who had been known in three different languages&#x2014;Hebrew, Portuguese, and Latin&#x2014;by a name that translates into &#x201c;blessed&#x201d;: Baruch, Bento, and Benedictus.<br><br> It is hard for us to appreciate the loneliness of Spinoza&#x2019;s secularized spirituality. For an individual of the early seventeenth century to live outside the bounds of a religious<br><br> identity&#x2014;to aim to be perceived as neither Jew, nor Christian, nor Moslem&#x2014;was all but unthinkable; and, in fact, Spinoza did continue to be called, with predictable disdain, a Jew. Huygens, for example, never refers to Spinoza by name in his letters, even though the two often conversed on such fields of mutual interest as mathematics and optics; but rather Spinoza is always &#x201c;the Jew of Voorburg&#x201d; or, even more belittlingly, &#x201c;our Israelite,&#x201d; &#x201c;our Jew.&#x201d;<br><br> The social frame of reference enclosing every individual of the premodern era was inherently religious. Spinoza&#x2019;s choice was an instance of a principle that had yet to be discerned in even the vaguest outline. Part of the horror he invoked throughout Europe derived from the radical stance he assumed simply by pursuing a life with no religious affiliation. Though the Romantic poet Novalis called him, and for good reason, &#x201c;God-intoxicated,&#x201d; he was also routinely excoriated as an atheist. He seemed to have been genuinely dismayed by the charge, though his conception of God is sufficiently peculiar&#x2014;and subtle&#x2014;that one can see how his constant talk of God might strike even us today as disingenuous, yet another old Marranoist trick of hiding one&#x2019;s unacceptable beliefs under formulaic insincerities.</p><h2>Things I Don&#39;t Want to Know: On Writing</h2><p><p><b>A shimmering jewel of a book about writing from two-time Booker Prize finalist Deborah Levy, to publish alongside her new work of nonfiction, <i>The Cost of Living</i>.</b></p><p>Blending personal history, gender politics, philosophy, and literary theory into a luminescent treatise on writing, love, and loss, <i>Things I Don't Want to Know </i>is Deborah Levy's witty response to George Orwell's influential essay "Why I Write."

It means being able to take on a wide variety of ideas and disciplines and put them all together in a way that they work together. It means thinking like G.K. Chesterton.The English author G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936) was one of the most prolific and well-known writers of his time, and one of the most widely quoted in our own. For newspapers and magazines, he wrote social commentary, literary criticism, and poetry with poignancy and wit. Creator of the beloved detective Father Brown, Chesterton also wrote novels and short stories. Thinking, wrote Chesterton, means connecting things. His ideas are not only connected to each other, they are also connected to us, showing that the thought of Chesterton is timeless. In a world of increasing specialization, Chesterton connects us to the big picture by helping us see how the many and varied elements within our experience fit together. He sheds light on almost every subject and opens doors from one thing to another with dazzling clarity. Drawing on literally hundreds of references from Chesterton&#39;s vast writings, Dale Ahlquist conducts a symphony, with Chesterton playing all the instruments in perfect harmony. Chesterton&#39;s thoughts on almost everything--from east to west, from old to new, from politics to economics, from Shakespeare to Dickens--are woven together to create an illuminating whole.</p><p><p><b>Dale Ahlquist</b> is president of the American Chesterton Society. Through his long running television series, <i>The Apostle of Common Sense</i>, as well as his books and lectures, he has helped bring about a great renewal of interest in the works of G. K. Chesterton. He has authored and contributed to several books on Chesterton, including <i>Common Sense 101: Lessons from G. K. Chesterton</i>, <i>G. K. Chesterton: The Apostle of Common Sense</i>, and <i>In Defense of Sanity: The Best Essays of G. K. Chesterton</i>.</p>"To write a book about Chesterton is a bold act since GKC's books render most commentary superfluous. But Dale Ahlquist has not only had the courage to make the attempt; he has the wit, the learning, and the grace to make his book worthwhile reading alongside the works of the master himself." --<b>Robert Royal</b>, Faith &amp; Reason Institute<br><br>"Dale Ahlquist is well known for his championing of the thought and writings of the great English writer and apologist G. K. Chesterton. In this book he has distilled years of reading and studying the writings of his hero. It will surely attract many new readers to Chesterton. Ahlquist himself has all the zeal of the convert and he will make many new converts with this trenchant study." --<b>Ian Ker</b>, Author, <i>G. K. Chesterton: A Biography</i><br><br>"Dale Ahlquist is a delightful student of Chesterton who has learned well from the Master. He combines Chesterton's amazing gift for being funny and profound, showing how everything from pork to pyrotechnics bears witness to the Maker of All in the great symphony of creation and redemption. Pure reading pleasure!" --<b>Mark P. Shea</b>, Author, <i>The Heart of Catholic Prayer</i></p><h2>Far More Terrible for Women: Personal Accounts of Women in Slavery (Real Voices, Real History)</h2><p><i><blockquote>De massa call me and tell me, "Woman, I&#x2019;s pay big money for you, and I&#x2019;s done dat 'cause I wants you to raise me chillum.

In all her years after freedom, she never had any desire to marry. Firsthand accounts of female slaves are few. The best-known narratives of slavery are those of Frederick Douglass and other men. Even the photos most people have seen are of male slaves chained and beaten. What we know of the lives of female slaves comes mainly from the fiction of authors like Toni Morrison and movies like&nbsp;<i>Gone With the Wind</i>. <em>Far More Terrible for Women</em>&nbsp;seeks to broaden the discussion by presenting 27 narratives of female ex-slaves. Editor Patrick Minges combed the WPA interviews of the 1930s for those of women, selecting a range of stories that give a taste of the unique challenges, complexities, and cruelties that were the lot of females under the &#x201c;peculiar institution.&#x201d;</p> <p>Patrick Minges worked for 17 years for Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

She lives in North Carolina.<p>Emma Rayburn shot bolt upright in bed, at first conscious of nothing except her heart pounding and the suffocating sense of being unable to breathe. Then she sucked in a gasp and slumped, her gaze darting around the room. Her room. Her bedroom, lit only by the pale light of dawn.</p><p>Not a dark forest. Not running and pain and terror.</p><p>Not a soaring end off the edge of a cliff.</p><p>Emma heard a soft whine, and leaned forward to pet the dog lying on the foot of her bed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, girl,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;Just a dream. Just another bad dream.&#x201d;</p><p>Her heartbeat was returning to normal, but the oppressive weight of dread she felt had hardly diminished at all. She looked at the clock on her nightstand, saw that her alarm would be going off in another hour anyway, and tossed back the covers to get out of bed.</p><p>She went to her dressing table across the room and turned on one of the small lamps. With cold hands, she removed a journal from the top drawer and looked through several pages before turning to a fresh page and reaching for a pen to make a simple entry.</p><p><i>June 22</i></p><i><p>Another nightmare, in the woods this time. Different: She was running. Trying to escape.</p><p>But the same ending. Always the same ending.</p></i><p><i>Another dead girl.</i></p><p>Emma stared at the entry for a long time, then slowly looked back through the earlier entries. They went back nearly two years, with casual entries of a day lived in uninteresting habit interspersed with stark dates and brief descriptions noting a nightmare of death.</p><p>The death of a girl or woman she never recognized, virtually all of them taking place in a dark, featureless room. Not a room she recognized, and yet she was absolutely certain it was somewhere in this area, in or near town. Near home. She didn&#x2019;t know why she was so sure, but the knowledge was as absolute as the awareness of her own heart beating.</p><p>In less than two years, she had dreamed about a dozen girls and women dying. Dying violently.</p><p>Emma didn&#x2019;t need the first diary entry to tell her when the nightmares had begun. They had begun after what had seemed a simple and fairly common accident.</p><p>Her family home, now a well&#x2013;respected and popular inn known as Rayburn House, offered its visitors various means of exploring the Appalachian Mountains surrounding this little valley where the small town of Baron Hollow was situated, and one of those means was guided trail riding on horseback.</p><p>Emma didn&#x2019;t ride often; she seldom had the time. But that day she had decided on the spur of the moment to go along with a group from Rayburn House. The trail ride had gone fine, just the same as it always did. Until . . .</p><p>Afterward, she had never been able to remember what had spooked her horse, but he had shied violently, catching her off guard, and Emma had fallen. Which wouldn&#x2019;t have done much harm, probably, except that her head had struck a granite boulder.</p><p>That casual decision to go riding had cost her more than a week in the town&#x2019;s small hospital, an almost invisible scar above her right temple that was easily hidden by her dark hair, and something new in her life. The doctors had been concerned because she had been unconscious for hours. They had worried about bleeding into the brain, they&#x2019;d told her. But that hadn&#x2019;t happened. The injury, they told her, had merely bruised a section of her frontal lobe.</p><p>Not like that had sounded scary or anything. Oh, no.</p><p>The list of symptoms she&#x2019;d been warned to watch out for had been sobering, everything from difficulty concentrating or completing complex tasks she&#x2019;d found easy to do before the accident, to changes in her personality or even loss of simple movement of body parts.</p><p>Paralysis.</p><p>None of that had happened, thank God, in the two years since the accident. Nothing had changed at all.</p><p>Except for the dreams. The nightmares.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re likely simple manifestations of the violence of your injury, Emma. That&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; Dr. Benfield had told her when she had finally found the nerve to ask him about it. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not uncommon after a head injury to experience in some sense a reliving of the pain and fear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it seems so real,&#x201d; she protested. &#x201c;I feel the terror, the pain. The panic.&#x201d; <i>It doesn&#x2019;t just seem real. It is real. I know it.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s what you felt when you had the accident.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, but&#x2014;&#x201d; <i>I also feel them die</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you talked to Chief Maitland? Are there missing women being reported, bodies being discovered? Deaths corresponding with the nights when you dream?&#x201d; His tone had been professional, but she had fancied a note in there somewhere of a doctor humoring his patient.</p><p>&#x201c;No, nothing like that,&#x201d; Emma answered reluctantly. &#x201c;I mentioned it to Dan after that girl went missing last summer, even checked on the Internet <i>and</i> back issues of the newspaper at the library, and other than her, there really hasn&#x2019;t been anything in the county. No reports of other missing girls or women who didn&#x2019;t turn up later somewhere. Anyway, I don&#x2019;t think I dreamed about that particular girl; there was a picture supplied by her boyfriend for the search parties. And he was probably right that she just hiked out of the mountains and caught a ride with someone after they argued. I heard later that was the case.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then your dreams aren&#x2019;t about real girls and women being horribly tortured and killed. Right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. Right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll probably go away on their own, Emma. But if they don&#x2019;t, or if you start having real trouble sleeping, let me know. There are meds that can help.&#x201d;</p><p>That had been a few months before, when she had talked to Dr. Benfield. She hadn&#x2019;t returned.</p><p>Even though the dreams hadn&#x2019;t stopped.</p><p>Emma stared down at the journal for a long time, then closed it, her hand absently smoothing the leather surface. She wasn&#x2019;t sure which frightened her more&#x2014;the possibility that her nightmares were just her still&#x2013;injured brain on some kind of memory loop, replaying a potentially life&#x2013;threatening accident again and again but giving the women in that terrifying little play different faces and torments, or that they were warnings to her that awful things really were happening in this small, tight&#x2013;knit town nestled in the mountains of Western North Carolina.</p><p>Bad things.</p><p>Things nobody else seemed to be aware of.</p><p>Haven</p><p><br>June 25</p><p>&#x201c;You know I usually don&#x2019;t ask,&#x201d; John Garrett said to his wife, Maggie, &#x201c;but are you sure this is a good idea?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Jessie needs something we can&#x2019;t give her, and whatever it is, it&#x2019;s interfering with her ability to work. Even her ability to live normally; the nightmares are hitting her harder each time, probably worse because she can&#x2019;t remember them.&#x201d;</p><p>They were standing in what the resident operatives referred to as Command Central: a large open space at the center of the sprawling house, and one of the common areas open to all. It contained plenty of casual seating, numerous worktables and computer stations, and a huge rock fireplace surrounded by the sort of sofa you could curl up on for a discussion, to read a book, or just to take an afternoon nap. There was an entire wall of reference books, and various cabinetry and furniture pieces hid office necessities such as printers, fax machines, and files.</p><p>It was a work space, yet it managed to feel comfortable and welcoming for all its clearly utilitarian purposes.</p><p>This was Haven, a privately owned and operated organization that provided trained operatives for various types of investigative work&#x2014;operatives who were also psychics. They worked sometimes in tandem with law enforcement and sometimes entirely on their own, for clients. Haven was the name of the organization, and it was the name given by its operatives to this house and compound, which sat on a rather remote and highly secure five&#x2013;hundred&#x2013;acre spread just outside Sante Fe, New Mexico.</p><p>John and Maggie Garrett had founded and now operated Haven, and this was their home as well as their work space, a home they shared with resident operatives who occupied their own suites of rooms here in the main house or in cottages that were part of the compound. For some it was most certainly, between assignments, a family atmosphere, and even those not yet quite sure where they belonged admitted to feeling a comforting sense of community here at Haven.</p><p>For most of them, it was the first time in their lives they weren&#x2019;t made to feel like freaks, and were able to relax living and working with others who also coped with both the highs and the lows of being &#x201c;blessed&#x201d; with special abilities.</p><p>At any given time, Haven could house as many as two dozen of their operatives. At the moment, there were twelve longtime residents, and four others spending a few months here in training.</p><p>Jessie Rayburn was one of the longtime residents.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know what the nightmares are about?&#x201d; John asked his wife, whose psychic ability was an extraordinary empathy with the emotions of others and the unique ability to in some cases absorb and even heal their emotional and physical traumas.</p><p>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Whatever the block is, it&#x2019;s solid. And I do mean solid. I can read more from her face about what she&#x2019;s feeling than anything empathically. She consented to having one of the telepaths try to get through again yesterday. He got nothing but a nosebleed for his trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>John frowned. &#x201c;Maybe she didn&#x2019;t want him to get through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If so, either it&#x2019;s totally unconscious or else she&#x2019;s a hell of an actress, because she fooled me.&#x201d; Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Look, we knew from the beginning there was a trauma somewhere in her past, something buried deep. At first, she was so shut down there was no sense even in trying to get at it. And she could function, as a telepath and as a medium, so there was time to let her settle in, find her footing. Get used to the work. There was always a chance that would help. We both know it does sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>John rested a hip on the corner of a desk and watched his wife sit down in the chair. They were, in this rare moment, alone in the room. &#x201c;Well, you handle the operatives, but my impression was that you were being very careful with her in the work. Partnering her with operatives who had a lot more experience and who&#x2019;re a lot more . . . grounded.&#x201d;</p><p>With a slight grimace, her golden eyes amused, Maggie said, &#x201c;You noticed that, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. And I&#x2019;m guessing she did too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unfortunately. Jessie is . . . stubborn. And proud. And she doesn&#x2019;t like to feel she&#x2019;s being coddled or in any way treated differently from the other operatives. So she came to me a few weeks ago and said she wanted to break through whatever was causing her abilities to be increasingly erratic. Causing the nightmares she could never remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to, or was ready to?&#x201d; John wasn&#x2019;t psychic himself, but he had worked with psychics long enough to understand them better than most.</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to. I&#x2019;m not at all sure she was or is ready to, subconsciously. But . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you tried. And none of the usual tools worked.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie shook her head. &#x201c;Once you rule out hypnosis, there really aren&#x2019;t that many quick ways to get at something in the human mind when the mind resists. A cognitive interview didn&#x2019;t work, because I didn&#x2019;t know where to start. Starting from when Jessie left Baron Hollow fifteen years ago was useless; she only remembered getting in her car and leaving, with the overwhelming sense that she had to go as soon as possible. And, like I said, another telepath didn&#x2019;t work. None of the psychological tests have given us anything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you call Bishop?&#x201d;</p><p>Unit Chief and Special Agent Noah Bishop was the third person responsible for the creation of Haven; his own Special Crimes Unit of the FBI was a team made up of psychics, and his idea that such abilities could be useful as investigative tools had proven over recent years to be successful beyond even his hopes.</p><p>&#x201c;I did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And . . . he was typically Bishop. He said Jessie would know if it was time to go back to the beginning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Meaning back to Baron Hollow.&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie nodded. &#x201c;Interestingly enough, Jessie walked in not ten minutes later asking if she could take her accumulated leave time and go back home for a visit.&#x201d;</p><p>John sighed. &#x201c;So . . . did he just know she&#x2019;d ask? Or does he know what fate has in store for her there?&#x201d; One of Bishop&#x2019;s several psychic abilities was precognition.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; Maggie paused, then added, &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s packing to go back home. And even though I can&#x2019;t read her, I know damned well she&#x2019;s scared.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess she wouldn&#x2019;t stand for it if we sent someone with her.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t really a question.</p><p>It was Maggie&#x2019;s turn to sigh. &#x201c;No. Her guard&#x2019;s always up with a partner, and there&#x2019;s no good way for me to send another operative otherwise.&#x201d;</p><p>John eyed his wife of several years. &#x201c;Uh&#x2013;huh. What is it you <i>aren&#x2019;t </i>telling me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just . . . a bad feeling.&#x201d;</p><p>Having learned through hard experience to respect his wife&#x2019;s emotions and intuitions, John&#x2019;s only question was, &#x201c;About Jessie? About her going home?&#x201d;</p><p>Maggie hesitated, frowning, then said, &#x201c;We have half a dozen operatives out in the field right now and three here who&#x2019;re going through difficult times emotionally and psychically; any of that could be responsible. I don&#x2019;t know what it is I&#x2019;m picking up on. Or who it&#x2019;s coming from.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So maybe not Jessie and her demons.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then all you can do,&#x201d; her husband reminded her, &#x201c;is warn Jessie to be careful and to check in while she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Maggie said. &#x201c;I just hope that&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;</p><p><br>June 27</p><p>&#x201c;This is such a bad idea.&#x201d;</p><p>Jessie Rayburn pulled her car over to the side of the road and put it into park just at the top of the hill in front of the First Baptist Church. It was a spot always considered to be the start of downtown, a spot where most of downtown was visible.</p><p>She rested her forearms on the steering wheel, gazing down on Main Street, Baron Hollow, North Carolina. Almost picture&#x2013;postcard perfect, a small town nestled in a valley of the Appalachian Mountains, a place where just about everybody knew everybody else. The locals, at least. Tourists were another matter entirely, passing through pretty much year&#x2013;round with their cameras and curiosity, leaving no mark of their visit behind.</p><p>Jessie had done a quick Web check before setting out, curious to find out if there had been any important changes in the town she&#x2019;d left behind.</p><p>With no major industry to support its work force, Baron Hollow&#x2019;s economic strength was its beautiful scenery and the charm of a small town where numerous shops and galleries offered locally created art and textiles and crafts, much of it renowned throughout the Southeast for its beauty and value. Mountain craftsmanship.</p><p>Well, all that and the reputed hauntings in various local areas, since ghost &#x201c;hunting&#x201d; had become so very popular in recent years. Baron Hollow had a long history of violence and odd events despite its peaceful, pretty appearance, which made it a prime location for paranormal researchers. Especially since so many of its buildings, commercial and residential, had been standing for a couple of centuries.</p><p>Once, the t...</p></p><h2>German Requiem in Full Score</h2><p><p>This edition of Brahms' greatest, most ambitious vocal work is reprinted from the definitive edition of the composer's works, prepared by Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel of Leipzig. Inexpensive but sturdily constructed to provide years of pleasurable use, this full score combines all the musical parts in a clear, readable format, with wide margins, large noteheads, and many other helpful features.<br>Brahms conducted the first major performance of the German Requiem in Bremen Cathedral in April 1868. The occasion &#x2014; attended by many distinguished musicians, among them Clara Schumann &#x2014; provided the 34-year-old composer with his first great public success. Scored for mixed chorus, solo voices, and full orchestra, the Requiem reflects Brahms' virtuosic grasp of nineteenth-century vocal technique as well as the polyphonic vocal traditions of the previous three centuries. Above all, it radiates Brahms' stalwart individuality, technical mastery, and stirring emotional appeal, which were soon to secure his unique position in the musical world. More than a century after its debut, this masterpiece of choral music is one of the most performed and recorded works in the repertoire of religious music.<br><br></p><p></p></p><p>Many composers--Mozart, Verdi, Durufle, Faure--have written settings of the requiem, the Roman Catholic mass for the dead, and the listener can find a score for every taste, from the bombastic to the reflective. In this 1865 composition, Johannes Brahms took a different tack. Instead of using the familiar texts of the Latin Mass, Brahms chose to write a <i>German</i> requiem with a decidedly evangelical tack. Using texts from the German translation of the Bible--beginning with a phrase from the Beatitudes and ending with the Revelation of St. John the Divine ("Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord ...") Brahms created one of the most comforting works of its kind ever written. (There are few greater evocations of heavenly bliss than No. 4, the chorus sung in English as "How lovely is thy dwelling place.") You can see how he did it with this full orchestral score from Dover.

She lives in San Francisco and is a professor of anthropology at St. Mary&#39;s College of California.With the help of anthropologist Mathieu, singer Namu describes growing up on the Chinese-Tibetan border in Moso country, "the Country of the Daughters." Detailing her late-1960s, early-'70s upbringing-she was known in her village as "the girl who was given back three times"-she sheds light on the unique matrilineal Moso culture, with its "walking marriages," where women take as many lovers as they want and the men continue to reside in their mothers' homes. The interweaving of the customs of this remote part of China-where "a man and a woman may sing to each other from the peaks of two mountains, but they will need to carry food for three days if they want to meet halfway"-with Namu's determination to have a worldly life despite her family's poverty and her own inability to read and write lend this tale poignancy. Most readers will find themselves rooting for Namu as she runs away from home, travels across the country and successfully auditions for a place in the Shanghai Music Conservatory at age 16. There, she learns to read and write and launches her international singing career. For those who doubt that a land could exist where girls are favored over boys and marriage is viewed with distrust, Mathieu appends an afterword about her research on the Moso and the changes that have taken place, including universal education. While not a stylistic masterpiece, the book brims with vivid descriptions of a fascinating culture. 1 b&amp;w photo, 2 maps. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Breaking Dawn</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p>Great love stories thrive on sacrifice. Throughout The Twilight Saga (<em>Twilight</em>, <em>New Moon</em>, and <em>Eclipse</em>), Stephenie Meyer has emulated great love stories--<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>--with the fated, yet perpetually doomed love of Bella (the human girl) and Edward (the vampire who feeds on animals instead of humans). In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the fourth and final installment in the series, Bella&#x2019;s story plays out in some unexpected ways. The ongoing conflicts that made this series so compelling--a human girl in love with a vampire, a werewolf in love with a human girl, the generations-long feud between werewolves and vampires--resolve pretty quickly, apparently so that Meyer could focus on Bella&#x2019;s latest opportunity for self-sacrifice: giving her life for someone she loves even more than Edward. How close she comes to actually making that sacrifice is questionable, which is a big shift from the earlier books. Even though you knew Bella would make it through somehow, the threats to her life, and to her relationship with Edward, had previously always felt real. It&#x2019;s as if Meyer was afraid of hurting her characters too much, which is unfortunate, because the pain Bella suffered at losing Edward in <em>New Moon</em>, and the pain Jacob suffered at losing Bella again and again, are the fire and the heart that drive the whole series. Diehard fans will stick with Bella, Edward, and Jacob for as many twists and turns as possible, but after most of the characters get what they want with little sacrifice, some readers may have a harder time caring what happens next.

He shows how that interaction of the divine with the human reveals the meaning of true freedom that man is always hungering for but often strives after in wrong and dangerous ways. He shows that God's free revelation of himself in Christ is an invitation to enter into the realm of absolute and divine freedom, in which alone human freedom can be fully realized. </p><p> From the true Christian there radiates the kind of freedom that is constantly being sought after by the non-Christian. In modern times, the freedom of man is a theme that preoccupies everyone. Atheistic philosophies are wholly taken up with this preoccupation. The Enlightenment was concerned with the freeing of reason from the "fetters of faith". Marx wrote about freeing man economically, and Freud wrote of freeing man from the bondage of a past as yet unmastered.</p><p> As opposed to those whose search for freedom urges them onward into a barren void, the Christian stands as the messenger of freedom accomplished and a freedom attainable by all. A true freedom of the sons and daughters of God.</p><p> "Just as <i>Love Alone Is Credible</i> captures the essence of the seven-volume <i>The Glory of the Lord</i>, so does <i>Engagement with God</i> explain his five-volume <i>Theo-Drama</i>. But here he does more: by setting his account of the drama of Christian discipleship against the anti-Christian ideologies of the 1960s he brings his theology to bear on the highest cost of discipleship--martyrdom--by seeing the martyr as the mirror of God's own involvement in the human race through his own martyred Son. One can hardly read a more sober, and yet exhilarating, account of what it means to live committed to God's own commitment to the world." </p><p><b> --Edward T. Oakes, S.

A Revolutionary Reinterpretation of the Evidence (Black &amp; White Edition)</h2><p>Jan Irvin and Andrew Rutajit delve deep into Judeo-Christian symbolism and mythology in Astrotheology &amp; Shamanism to reveal the true origins of Christianity in fertility cults and entheogenic drug use. The authors show, with the use of numerous images, textual citations, and etymological analyses, how the symbols used in Christian art and encoded in sacred texts reference sacramental use of psychedelic mushrooms as well as ancient astronomical knowledge. This knowledge has been kept secret from the public, however, and the truth has remained concealed behind a campaign to prohibit access to entheogenic sacraments through a Pharmacratic Inquisition (of which the current &#x201c;War on Drugs&#x201d; is the latest manifestation). Along with a call to wake up to the true history of Judeo-Christian tradition, the authors call for a return to direct spiritual experience through visionary sacraments unmediated through dominating religious institutions. This is a powerful and provocative book that is sure to challenge and inspire. - Martin W.

This offers comfort and predictability by allowing neat compartments for diverse things, but also leads to elaborately complex symbols and belief systems over time.

The mystery is, however, revealed in various art forms often hidden away or obscured in some clever fashion. All these traditions&#x2014;Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indus Valley&#x2014;have their origins in shamanic experiences with mind-altering substances. This was not recreational; this was serious business.

But the disintegration of Fuller&#x2019;s own marriage leaves her shattered. Looking to pick up the pieces of her life, she confronts tough questions about her past, about the American man she married, and about the family she left behind in Africa. Fuller soon realizes that what is missing from her life is something that was always there: the brash and uncompromising ways of her father. &#x201c;Tim Fuller of No Fixed Abode&#x201d;&#x2014;familiar to readers from Alexandra Fuller&#x2019;s<i> New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling memoir <i>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</i>&#x2014;was a man who regretted nothing and wanted less, even after fighting harder and losing more than most men could bear.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Leaving Before the Rains Come</i> showcases Fuller at the peak of her abilities, threading panoramic vistas with her deepest revelations as a fully grown woman and mother.

In <i>Leaving Before the Rains Come</i>, Alexandra Fuller&#x2019;s third memoir (she also wrote two other books of nonfiction), the author confirms what readers of <i>Don&#x2019;t Let&#x2019;s Go to the Dogs Tonight</i> detected on first reading of that debut: Fuller belongs in the pantheon of great memoirists, right alongside Mary Karr, Tobias Wolff, and Frank McCourt. Not unlike those writers, Fuller has a single trope &#x2013; hers is a childhood spent as a British expat on a farm in revolution-torn southern Africa &#x2013; that she uses over and over to define and clarify her life The title expression, for example, is a south Africanism for &#x201c;get out while you can,&#x201d; and throughout this heartfelt book, she uses experiences, images and memories from her twenty years in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, and from the people she knew there, to illustrate more contemporary and local places and states of mind. Here, the focus is on the men in her life &#x2013; for one, her heavy-drinking, plain-talking, fatalistic father who says thing like &#x201c;Those who talk the most, usually have the least to say.&#x201d; The other is Charlie, her now-ex-husband, an American mainline Philadelphia neo-cowboy who seems at first to be the perfect strong-and-sensitive type, all pragmatism to her barely controlled (but charming) chaos. While the book is ostensibly about their union, and its ultimate dissolution, it is also about memory and childhood and nature and modern life. Charlie and &#x201c;Bobo&#x201d; (Fuller&#x2019;s family nickname, though she is sometimes also called &#x201c;Al&#x201d;) live together through elephant attacks (on their first date), malaria (on their wedding day) and relocation (from the wilds of Africa to the tamer wilds of Wyoming) but it is a more prosaic disaster that fells them: the real estate crash of 2008. What exactly went on emotionally between Charlie and Bobo is never fully explained &#x2013; if you asked her, I&#x2019;d bet she&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s because she is still trying to figure it out &#x2013; but the chords of loss she strikes resonate loudly and universally. Still, this is not a depressing book, thanks largely to Fuller&#x2019;s winsome wit (she thought &#x201c;mainline Philadelphia&#x201d; meant that Charlie&#x2019;s people were heroin addicts who happened to live in Pennsylvania) and unabashed admissions: she had nine novels rejected by publishers before figuring out she should write nonfiction. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine there&#x2019;s much more for Fuller to say about her life &#x2013; and yet, I might have said that after the last memoir. Somehow, always, she finds another thread to weave into another masterpiece. <i>--Sara Nelson</i></p><b>Alexandra Fuller</b> was born in England in 1969.

On many summer afternoons, packs of surfacing Bluefish chase up small fish, drawing excited flocks of diving terns. The terns carry those little fish a few miles to hungry youngsters waiting eagerly on small, unpeopled islands. As it has been for millennia, so it is this very moment.</p><p>Having long studied&#x2014;and saut�ed&#x2014;this aspect of our neighborhood both formally and at leisure, applying both statistical models and garlic as appropriate, I can report that this relationship&#x2014;prey fish, terns, Bluefish, and me&#x2014;shows scant sign of failing anytime soon.</p><p>The future is by no means doomed. I&#x2019;m continually struck by how much beauty and vitality the world still holds.</p><p>But beauty and vitality isn&#x2019;t the whole story either. In the panic among the fishes and in the frenzying terns, it&#x2019;s also evident that nature has neither sentiment nor mercy. What it does have is life, truth, and logic. And it strives for what it cannot have: an end to danger, an assurance of longevity, a moment&#x2019;s peace, and a comfortable death. It&#x2019;s like us all, because we are natural. What anyone needs to know about mercy, one can learn by watching nature strive, seeing people struggle, and realizing what a compassionate mind could add to the picture. So I&#x2019;m also struck that we who have named ourselves &#x201c;wise humans&#x201d;&#x2014;<em>Homo sapiens</em>&#x2014;haven&#x2019;t quite realized that nature, civilization, peace, and human dignity are all facets of the same gemstone, and that abrasion of one tarnishes the whole.</p><p>My neighbor&#x2019;s cottage is right on the bay, and where I launch my kayak I find him wading waist-deep with a spade, digging sea-worms for bait. Bob hopes to slide a few porgies into his frying pan by sundown. I ask how the worm digging&#x2019;s going. Squinting against shards of summer light jabbing upward from the water, he says, &#x201c;S-l-o-w. Even the worms are getting scarcer.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d earlier commented on the dearth of clams. Just a few years ago we could wade out right here and, using merely our feet to detect buried clams, emerge in an hour lugging four dozen. The hour now yields perhaps half a dozen. Nothing too mysterious; a few too many people from elsewhere, having raked over their spots, found our spot. The whole world has a pretty similar story to tell.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t pretend to speak for the sea-worms or the clams. The voiceless among us got on for hundreds of millions of years without hearing from me.</p><p>It&#x2019;s true that a lot was gone by the time I got here, and that worms are waning and clams are counting down. But, there&#x2019;s quite a lot left. Maybe not a lot of clams (though I&#x2019;ve found a couple of decent pockets in the harbor, and my neighbor Dennis generously clued me to a heavy set over in&#x2014;well, I probably shouldn&#x2019;t say), but I mean in general, a lot remains. And some of what had gone has returned. You&#x2019;ll see. As watching those terns and fish and the activities of my human neighbors continually reminds me, the world still brims with the living.</p><p>Yet here&#x2019;s the paradox: In the cycle of seasons and the waves of migrating fishes and birds that come and go along my home coast, I still find sanity, solace, and delight, more than a few fresh meals, and the power and resilience of living things; the wider lens of distant horizons, however, reveals people and nature up against trends serious enough to rattle civilization in this century.</p><p>This is a chronicle of a year spent partly along local shores, partly exploring the world from polar regions of the Arctic, across the tropics, down into the Antarctic, and home again. In some ways, this could be any year; in some ways, it couldn&#x2019;t be any other.</p><p>The world still sings. Yet the warnings are wise. We have lost much, and we&#x2019;re risking much more. Some risks, we see coming. But there are also certainties hurtling our way that we fail to notice. The dinosaurs failed to anticipate the meteoroid that extinguished them. But dinosaurs didn&#x2019;t create their own calamity. Many others don&#x2019;t deserve the calamities we&#x2019;re creating.</p><p>We&#x2019;re borrowing heavily from people not yet born. Meanwhile, the framework with which we run our lives and our world&#x2014;our philosophy, ethics, religion, and economics&#x2014;can&#x2019;t seem to detect the risks we&#x2019;re running. How could they? They&#x2019;re ancient and medieval institutions, out of sync with what we&#x2019;ve learned in the last century about how the world really works.</p><p>So, how to proceed? I&#x2019;ve come to see that the geometry of human progress is an expanding circle of compassion. And that nature and human dignity require each other. And I believe that&#x2014;if the word &#x201c;sacred&#x201d; means anything at all&#x2014;the world exists as the one truly sacred place. Simple things, right?</p><p>As we walk the shores and launch our travels, several axes of possibility&#x2014;evidence, ignorance, indifference, and compassion&#x2014;will form the north, south, east, and west upon which we&#x2019;ll plot our course.</p><p>Amagansett, Long Island<br>June 2010</p><p><strong>The View from Lazy Point</strong></p><p>My dog, Kenzie, a fifty-pound black wolf&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;goes loping along the shore as is her custom, energetically invested in the obvious truth that all adventure lies at the tip of one&#x2019;s nose. The familiar is always also the exotic, and if you can detect the scent and follow it, it&#x2019;ll take you far. And soon, as always, she&#x2019;s way ahead.</p><p>Today we woke to glass-calm water. The Sound is stretched taut to the far points of land. Out across the open water, the sea melds with hazy air and blends skyward without horizon. On a morning this placid and beautiful, dying and going to heaven wouldn&#x2019;t be worth it.</p><p>A few years ago, I became the &#x201c;owner&#x201d; of a beach cottage that had fallen into such disrepair that I could afford it. One can own an apartment or a condo or a suburban home, but when a place is already old, and if it sits amid dune grass and wild Beach Plums, and a box turtle comes confidently seeking the blackberries it has known about for decades, you feel&#x2014;at least I feel&#x2014;like the property has many owners and I&#x2019;m just the newest tenant.</p><p>As much as I admire Henry Beston&#x2019;s classic <em>The Outermost House,</em> this is not a story about getting a little place out past the edge of the world and finding one&#x2019;s self in the solitude and the peace. This story is, though, partly about going home, about immersing in rhythms that come naturally. As a kid I&#x2019;d stalk shallow waters with a net in my hand, captivated by shadows of tiny sand-colored fishes fanning away from me. Despite added detail and time, I&#x2019;m still the minnow-chasing boy.</p><p>But this story&#x2019;s also partly about a kind of heartbreak for a world that remains so vitally unaware of how imperiled it is. The more I sense the miracle, the more intense appears the tragedy. The only way to feel better, then, is to appreciate less, which would of course feel worse. Let&#x2019;s put a positive spin on it and say that for now the miracle is winning.</p><p>So this story is also about the tension created when those things mistakenly called &#x201c;the real world&#x201d;&#x2014;though they are entirely artificial&#x2014;continually intrude on the <em>real</em> real world. In a <em>real</em> place, the mysteries of ages pile thick with enduring truths and complex beauties.</p><p>And that&#x2019;s why I was looking for a house. I&#x2019;d hoped to find a home in a certain fishing village. Well, the fishing village was turning into a resort, with prices to match. The next town was long since unaffordable, too. So one day I ended up down a road through a marsh popular with mosquitoes, looking at a dilapidated summer cottage with no windows and a square hole in the roof with no skylight. It was bright&#x2014;and certainly airy&#x2014;but humidity posed a problem. Some of the inner walls had been torn from the studs, freeing a bloom of insulation and leaving exposed wires in a puddle under the skylight hole. Better houses have been demolished. I wisely dismissed that house as a wreck, out of the question.</p><p>I walked across the street, over the dune, and got a glimpse of the water. A five-minute beach walk took me to where a broad, shallow bay communicates with the Sound through a deep, fast-flowing channel about as wide as I might be able to cast a heavy lure. Even in the late winter, when I first laid eyes on it, I could see that this channel would be fishy in springtime. The house said I&#x2019;d be crazy. The place said I was home.</p><p>It&#x2019;s called Lazy Point. I&#x2019;ve been told the name derives from ne&#x2019;er-do-well baymen who&#x2019;d come to squat on worthless land. Whether or not that&#x2019;s true, I don&#x2019;t much care; I like the name.</p><p>In summer the place is idyllic; it can make anyone lazy. But in winter it takes effort to get comfortable with the gales. I once read that the incessant howl of wind on the prairie could drive settlers mad. I couldn&#x2019;t really understand how&#x2014;until my first winter alone at Lazy Point.</p><p>The cottages sit on a flat peninsula of scrubby pines between the Sound and the bay. That fishy channel I mentioned; I call it &#x201c;the Cut.&#x201d; Along the bay&#x2019;s south shore runs the railroad, then the main road&#x2014;two lanes&#x2014;then high dunes, then the sandy ocean beach that continues on for miles. In winter it&#x2019;s deserted and I have it to myself. We call the ocean beach &#x201c;the south side.&#x201d; And beyond the ocean: more ocean to the blue horizon, beyond that to the edge of the continental shelf&#x2014;under six hundred feet of water&#x2014;and then the deep sea, the Gulf Stream, and the rest of the world. You can feel it.</p><p>The harbor village is about five miles east; another six miles and you get to Montauk Point, a defiantly reared-up, jutting jaw of land&#x2014;exposed to the open ocean on the south, and e...</p></p><h2>The Dinosaur Princess (The Dinosaur Lords, 3)</h2><p><p><b>Victor Milan's <i>The Dinosaur Princess</i> is a thrilling epic fantasy adventure set in an alternative world of intrigue, beauty, brutality...and dinosaurs.</b><br><b></b><br><b>WELCOME TO PARADISE: </b>A primordial world with every species of dinosaur, large and small.

Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) during the final 3 years of its 4-year lifespan, from 1995 to 1998, and is the first U.S. government official involved with the medical evidence to allege a coverup in JFK&#39;s autopsy, and in the creation of the autopsy photos and x-rays. This book, the product of over 13 years of writing and research, provides the best explanation yet offered of the true nature of the medical coverup in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and does so in meticulous detail, with scrupulous use of primary source material. It incorporates the latest information---much of it new evidence not revealed elsewhere---gleaned from the ARRB&#39;s depositions and interviews of medical witnesses. With precise accuracy, and with a relentless focus on the massive fraud uncovered in the official records of the 35th President&#39;s assassination, Horne presents a persuasive case that the assassination of JFK was an &#34;inside job,&#34; a true coup d&#39;etat in America, that was ruthlessly and brazenly covered up by those who &#39;broke the back of the American century&#39; in Dallas on November 22, 1963. IN VOLUME FIVE, THE AUTHOR EXPLAINS THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT IN WHICH THE ASSASSINATION OCCURRED: A MAELSTROM OF TURBULENT DOMESTIC POLITICS DISTORTED BY THE CORRUPTION OF INDIVIDUAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND BY THE TENSIONS AND STRESSES OF THE COLD WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION. HE PRESENTS A COMPELLING CASE THAT THE ASSASSINATION OF JFK WAS A CONSENSUS DECISION MADE BY KEY PLAYERS IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY ESTABLISHMENT, WHO BOTH FEARED AND DESPISED JFK&#39;S BOLD AND PROGRESSIVE FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVES. DETERMINED TO PREVENT HIM FROM ENDING THE COLD WAR, THIS CABAL (WHICH WANTED TO WIN THE COLD WAR, NOT END IT) CAST A VETO ON HIS LIFE SO THAT HE COULD NOT IMPLEMENT IRREVERSIBLE CHANGES TO THE WORLD ORDER IN A SECOND TERM.

He has protected his wife and daughter as best he can from the war and hatred that has torn Syria apart. If they stay, they will lose their freedom, will become lesser persons. If they flee, they will lose all they have known of home, for some intangible dream of refuge in some faraway land across the merciless sea. <br><br>Lampy is distracted; he has too much going on in his small town life in Ireland. He has the city girl for a bit of fun, but she's not Chloe, and Chloe took his heart away when she left him. There's the secret his mother will never tell him. His granddad's little sniping jokes are getting on his wick. And on top of all that, he has a bus to drive; those old folks from the home can't wait all day.<br><br>The game was always the lifeblood coursing through John's veins: manipulating people for his enjoyment, or his enrichment, or his spite. But it was never enough. The ghost of his beloved brother, and the bitter disappointment of his father, have shadowed him all his life. But now that lifeblood is slowing down, and he's not sure if God will listen to his pleas for forgiveness. Three men, searching for some version of home, their lives moving inexorably towards a reckoning that will draw them all together.</p><p>Donal Ryan is the author of <i>The Spinning Heart</i>, <i>The Thing About December</i>, <i>A Slanting of the Sun</i>, and <i>All We Shall Know</i> which have all been published to major acclaim. <i>The Spinning Heart </i>won the Guardian First Book Award, the EU Prize for Literature (Ireland), and Book of the Year at the Irish Book Awards, and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Desmond Elliott Prize.

They speak to each other. Just think what they must say. What could a tree have to say to a tree? Lots and lots. I bet they could talk for ever. Some of them live for centuries. The things they must see, that must happen around them, the things they must hear. They speak to each other through tunnels that extend from their roots, opened in the earth by fungus, sending their messages cell by cell, with a patience that could only be possessed by a living thing that cannot move. It would be like me telling you a story by saying one word each day. At breakfast I would say it, the word of the story, then I'd kiss you and I'd go to work and you'd go to school and all you'd have of the story is that single word each day and I would give no more until the next day, no matter how you begged. You'll have to have the patience of a tree, I'd say. Can you imagine how that would be? If a tree is starving, its neighbours will send it food. No one really knows how this can be, but it is. Nutrients will travel in the tunnel made of fungus from the roots of a healthy tree to its starving neighbour, even one of a different species. Trees live, like you and me, long lives, and they know things. They know the rule, the only one that's real and must be kept. What's the rule? You know. I've told you lots of times before. Be kind. Now sleep, my love, tomorrow will be long.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He stopped on the short landing and watched her through the cracked door, shifting in her sheets to find the most comfortable way of lying. He could hear gunfire from the east,</p><p>beyond the town, short of the front line, and he wondered if the</p><p>shots were being fired in celebration, or in anger, or in tribute to some fallen warrior. He wondered if his daughter believed his lie - that the gunfire was the noise of a great machine that was being used to frighten birds away from crops. It was for the birds' own good, he'd told her: they'd gorge themselves till they were sick if they were let. He could hear her whispering to herself, or to her teddies and her dolls, ranged along the bed's edge, questioning: Could that be true, what Daddy said? That trees can talk to other trees? It must be true, or else he wouldn't have told me. I don't know if I'll tell my friends. Maybe I'll just keep it for me and all of you, and we can think about it just ourselves, and dream about it, maybe. Well, goodnight, babies. And she whispered each of their names in turn, and settled in the semi-dark, and there were only the sounds of the cicadas, and her breaths, and in the far distance another series of crackling bursts, like dry leaves underfoot fragmenting to dust. And the memory stung him again, so sharply this time that he almost sighed aloud, of how he'd hoped and prayed to God that she'd be born a boy. The moon was visible in the skylight above the landing and the stairs were drenched in its sickly light, and he felt a sudden hatred for it, the dead thing that circled one-faced and tide-locked above the earth, feeling nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Martha was sitting at the dining table, her forearms extended along its heavy wooden top, her fingers stretched, a mug before her, her face tilted towards the steam that wisped from it, her eyes closed. He thought of how she'd sat in just that spot weeks before and spoken animatedly to a strange and dangerous man, how she'd smiled at him and laughed at things he said, a laugh calculated to please the man, to reassure him she was well disposed towards him, that she</p><p>believed the things he said, the reasons he gave for doing what he did. Farouk had watched their interaction through the garden window as he'd smoked with the man's companion, a stick-thin youth of maybe twenty, with blemished skin beneath his patchy beard, the marks of pimples, of acne, the scars of the threshold of manhood. She'd wanted to speak to the man in charge, to get a sense of him, to see if he had solidness, a kind of ballast to his bearing. She was doing her best, he knew, to ease her terror, so she wouldn't opt to stay, to see if they could sit it out, this strange confluence of opposing certainties, this tiny Armageddon. The thin youth had sat in silence, looking now and then from the garden through the window towards his boss and the beautiful woman to whom he was speaking, and back to the woman's husband, and he'd grin, and raise his eyebrows, and exhale the smoke of his cigar-ette upwards in a thin stream, and nod, smiling, in approval, or reassurance, or just to be doing something, to mitigate the awkwardness somehow, the stilted silence that hung between them; it was impossible to say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He had hated his wife in that moment, though he couldn't say for certain why. Because she was so able, maybe, to converse with a man so unknowable, a man whose word, he knew, could not be taken as truth. He felt humiliated, sitting outside his own house, on a stool beneath an olive tree, nodding back and forth with an idiot, inhaling foul tobacco simply because it had been offered to him and he'd been reluctant to appear cold or indifferent. He wasn't sure of himself: he wasn't able even to walk without considering his gait, the sureness of his step, whether his bearing seemed manly enough, whether his</p><p>handshake was firm enough, without being so firm as to represent a challenge to the strangers, transmitted through their fingers and their palms. And he'd been careful to look away first once the greeting was done, and down at the ground between them, and this small act had caused a diminution in him, a terrible contraction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted her to stand in front of him and bow her head and lower her eyes and beg for his forgiveness, for closing out the deal he'd made, for taking the envelope of money from the shelf above the stove, for counting out the notes in little piles along the table, while he sat and smoked with a gurning boy, a sap-filled, leering youth. She'd gone too far: she'd only been meant to speak to him of her fears about the boat, to ask him of its type and provenance, and the size and experience of its crew. They'd agreed she would do this without him, so she'd be free to take liberties in her interrogation; if he was present he'd be obliged to rebuke her for speaking so volubly and insolently - they had no knowledge of the sensibilities of these people, of the way they might take things. And so he'd said to the one in charge, as they'd shaken hands in the doorway: My wife is afraid of the crossing, of the sea. She's never sailed before, but she has researched these matters. Perhaps you might allow her some technical details of the craft and of the course of our voyage, and of the skill of the crew, just to</p><p>smooth the first part of our journey, to get us without drama</p><p>to the port, you know how it is. And his mouth dried as he spoke the words, and the thick-limbed man laughed softly, and a light in his eyes danced, as he said, Of course, my friend, I know how it is.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His breath caught now as he thought of it on the moonlit staircase as he descended, slowly, as quietly as he could, towards the soft billow of his wife's blouse where it moved in the delicately shifting air in and out from her skin, and a million prickles broke along his brow and down his neck and back and front, and down along his arms and legs to his feet and hands as his blood quickened and his heart beat in time with his clenching fists.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His wife stirred as he reached the lowest step, and she turned her head so her chin rested against her shoulder, and her face was tilted towards him but her eyes were fixed on some point far away, and he found himself checking her face and her eyes for evidence of tears, shed already or about to be shed, and he realized suddenly that he'd been hoping to see evidence of tears, of some kind of erosion of her alien strength, her seemingly unshakeable confidence in the rightness of their actions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The war had come slowly, had accreted around them rather than exploded at their door. The police had turned to a militia. The town had filled with strangers armed with guns. A flogged woman was thrown one early evening from the back of a lorry onto the ground outside the hospital. She was bleeding heavily and her clothes were wadded and matted into the wounds on her back. There was a sign around her neck saying ADULTERESS. She was no more than twenty and one of the nurses seemed to know her, because she was crying as the semi-conscious woman was lifted into the hospital on</p><p>a sheet, and she tried to straighten the arm that dangled</p><p>at a strange angle from the makeshift gurney, broken perhaps in the fall from the high flatbed of the lorry, and the nurse was saying, O cousin, O cousin, what did you do? And one of the men who'd thrown the flogged woman from the</p><p>lorry climbed down from the flatbed and walked towards</p><p>the hospital entrance and addressed the people standing there. He spoke slowly and falteringly in Arabic, in a foreign accent, saying, This woman's life was spared because a fine was paid by her family. She is not to be touched by a man. If there is no woman doctor a nurse can be instructed through an open doorway from another room. From this day forward there will be two hospitals, one for men and one for women. The women's hospital will be set up in the school. Boys will be</p><p>instructed elsewhere. Girls will stay at home. The man's face was red where it was not pasty white; his cheeks were puffed and his eyes were small and bulbous behind round spectacles; he wore a combat uniform and a rifle was slung on his shoulder and a long, curved knife like a scimitar was sheathed on his hip. He was German, Farouk guessed. He couldn't look away from him, this blotched, exotic specimen, this convert, filled to bursting with moral rectitude, with excitement at his new station, at the dream he was living. The fat German turned away and two of his comrades took an arm each and hoisted him back up on the lorry's bed and they were gone in a plume of dust.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd lost a third or so of the blood of her body and stock was running low. A senior doctor advised that the wounds be cleaned and sutured and salved with antibiotic cream and that she be hydrated and nourished and allowed to regenerate her own blood; she wasn't in dire need. The only female doctor in the hospital was nearly seventy and unused to dealing with wounds of this nature; this was a small and prosperous town, gout was a problem, and certain cancers were prevalent, and most people died of old age. We'll have to do as they say, she told Farouk that evening. We'll have to set up in the schoolhouse, starting now. This patient can't be left here, and almost all the other female patients can be discharged or walked to the new building, and we'll pray to God to keep us from the centre of the storm. If we're faced with heavy casualties we have no hope. The flogged woman moaned softly and the nurse who was her relative put a wet towel to her forehead and then to her lips and she shushed her and said, Rest, cousin, and be quiet. Don't cause us any more trouble. Your wounds are already half healed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so the hospital divided its patients and its staff, and Farouk and the other doctors awaited the tide, and whenever he was able to he drove to the schoolhouse with whatever supplies could be spared. The women's hospital was bare, save for a row of low cots made from timber salvaged from the desks of the school. The female doctor and her two frightened, defiant nurses gave him a list of medicines and equipment they required each time he visited and all he could say was, I'll see. Maybe you could ask the Red Cross. But the fighting hadn't reached their town, only extended now and then in sorties from the south; it was a base from where the rebels launched</p><p>attacks and regrouped afterwards, and the men's hospital had to treat the rebel casualties. And one of those evenings he</p><p>had walked back to his car to find a strange, dark-eyed, heavyset man resting against it, who had said: I will get you and your wife and your daughter to Europe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the things that are known about you to the strangers in this town. Your wife does not cover herself. Her mother is a Christian from the north. Your father was some kind of apostate. You yourself are not observant and your home is unclean and your daughter is Westernized. He began</p><p>to protest but the man dismissed this, saying, It's nothing to me, my friend. I don't believe in God. If He exists He has nothing to say to me nor I to Him. If ever I'm faced with Him I'll shrug my shoulders and say, I did what I did, you do what you must do. My business is transporting people from danger to safety. I believe in life, and I believe in making money, so that I may continue my work. I am an honest man. If you stay here your daughter will be taken as a bride for some so-called warrior and she will be raped. Your wife will be raped. You will be used until they have no more use for you and then</p><p>you will be killed. Farouk knew that this man was in the business of fear, of extorting money from people and taking</p><p>the guise of a saviour, but he well knew the truth that was buried in the man's exaggerations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He felt foolish now as he remembered how he had searched the stranger's face and eyes as he had spoken, how he had</p><p>tried to listen beyond what was spoken for the truth of him. How he had felt a childish pleasure when the trafficker had changed his tack from fear to flattery, asking him how it was to be a doctor, to be a man so educated and respected; how he had been touched when the trafficker had declared that if he ever had a son, and the boy grew up to be a man like him, a doctor with a beautiful wife, he would feel all his days had been worth living; he would die without regret. He remembered how he had revelled in the approbation of this thickset stranger, this dealer in flesh, how he'd been lulled and wooed by his softly wheedling voice, by the suggestion that the world somehow needed him more so than other men, that his wife and daughter had some claim above others on salvation.</p></p><h2>Everyday Moon Magic: Spells &amp; Rituals for Abundant Living (Everyday Series, 2)</h2><p><p>That magical, mystical, glorious Moon&#x2015;invite her power into your life every day, from fixing your computer to blessing your pets.

His adventure begins with a prayer to Athena Parthenos, who appears to him bearing gifts: his armor, his famous bow, a mysterious leather pouch, and seven unusual arrows. She then sends him on a quest through the Underworld along with Diomedes, his friend from the Trojan War who had been sharing in his eternal punishment. To complete their escape, the goddess warns them, they must recover their squandered honor and learn to use &#x201c;the eighth arrow&#x201d;.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At turns exciting, humorous, and edifying, this action-packed epic follows Odysseus and Diomedes as they journey through all the circles of Dante&#x2019;s Hell, where they encounter various characters from Greek mythology, ancient history, and Renaissance literature, including Helen of Troy,Cerberus, Penelope, Homer, Harpies, Centaurs, and eventually Satan himself. With witty banter and wily stratagems, the two Greek warriors fight their way through the obstacles that stand between them and redemption.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Eighth Arrow is a thoroughly entertaining jailbreak story. Full of allusions to great works of old, it is also gently educational, and as such it can be read as a guide or a companion to Dante&#x2019;s Inferno and the works of Homer.</p><p>Fourteen years in the making...<p><b>Fr.

Had been smacking bitches on their asses and then running away from them. Then one started yelling real loud and this cop appeared out of nowhere and we just started running. Nene was behind me, he was always smaller, more frail&#x2014;that cat was always sick, ever since he was a little kid, there was always some shit wrong with him. So I&#x2019;m just jettin, but I always used to look over my shoulder for him. That was a habit. But this time I heard him scream before I looked, and then I see my man go down over some rocks. And he tumbles, and I imagine the rocks pierce his back, and he&#x2019;s stuck there for life. Me and the cop get to him at the same time, and my instinct is just to grab him. But this cop dude is like no, you should leave him where he is, you&#x2019;ll hurt him more. But everything in me is fighting to grab him and pull him up. He looks all fucked up, like someone dropped Humpty Dumpty, and I want to put him back together. Set everything right, so he&#x2019;s whole again. Nene was always strong, I mean he was always sick, but you know he was always down to go outside with us and terrorize the neighborhood. And he would play with that sick shit too. See, everyone on the block knew he was the sick one and no matter what he&#x2019;d done the previous day they always let the shit go. So sometimes I would have to leave him where he was because he wasn&#x2019;t going to catch it, but my ass would.</p> <p>***<br>It didn&#x2019;t even start with him sucking my dick. No foreplay shit like that. I watch movies, and it always starts like that, the inevitable creep to the dick. Nene was sleeping over at my house, and it was finally quiet at three in the morning, and that&#x2019;s when he starts. I have my back to him with nothing but my underwear on. And then I feel it next to me, on my skin. Right up against my ass. Then he&#x2019;s pushing harder, trying to find the hole. He breaks through, and it&#x2019;s a whole new life.</p> <p>The next morning he looks sick as shit, coughing all over the place, so my moms takes him home because she&#x2019;s scared I&#x2019;ll get whatever he has. But she doesn&#x2019;t understand that never have I caught what Nene has. But she becomes the concerned mother all of a sudden and takes him away.</p> <p>***<br>After the fall, we are all sitting in the hospital waiting. And I cry, but not those tears of sadness, it&#x2019;s the tears of anger. The kind where you can&#x2019;t breathe, my face gets all hot, and I can&#x2019;t hold it in at all. Guttural noises are scattered in with my language. My fists are in a ball, and I just want to hit myself. My mother doesn&#x2019;t understand this rage. If only she would just shut the fuck up and let me cry...all she&#x2019;s done is tell me that I have to be strong. But what does strength have to do with love?</p> <p>He doesn&#x2019;t get out of the hospital for weeks, and when he does he can&#x2019;t walk anymore. I&#x2019;m on the stoop, and we see him coming down the street, but Nene doesn&#x2019;t look all sad and shit. For us nothing has changed, so we&#x2019;re just happy to have him home. His mother won&#x2019;t let him come out today though. She says he has to rest in bed first, figure out how to go to the bathroom, shit like that. That makes him sad. But then he knows he&#x2019;ll be out tomorrow. <br>I come out the next day and I wait for him. It&#x2019;s me and Kenny that are just waiting and by like eleven he&#x2019;s still not down there. So I stand on the sidewalk and I yell, Neeeneeee, Neeeneeee, over and over again until his moms sticks her head out the window and starts yelling at me. Don&#x2019;t you know he can&#x2019;t walk? You need to get your lazy ass upstairs and knock on the door like a normal human being. I laugh and I run up because at least I know he can come out and hang with us. He&#x2019;s still sitting in his bed when I get there. The lock of hair on his forehead is wet. And I&#x2019;m like, my man you need a haircut, you look like John Travolta and shit. His house is mad hot. I pull the covers off of him and his legs look like my sisters, thin and pale. Not me. I&#x2019;m already brown but this burning summer has me even darker, so if I was sick you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tell just by looking at me. You can see everything written on this cat&#x2019;s face. On his body. I pick him up and put him in his chair. Then I wheel him to the bathroom. But I make the ride exciting, I&#x2019;m crashing into the wall, I try to zoom here and there, but in reality his apartment is too small for that. I call his mother to shower him. I&#x2019;d be scared to undress him, to see him naked. I always have my back to him, and it&#x2019;s always a surprise. I expect it whenever he&#x2019;s at my house, but I can&#x2019;t tell you the precise moment, only that it&#x2019;s after the house is quiet. I tell her I&#x2019;ll be downstairs waiting for him. She&#x2019;s like, you better not fuck around, I need you to come back up here because I need you to carry Nene down the stairs.</p> <p>I go downstairs and have all this energy, but all I can do is wait for Nene. Kenny sits on the stoop, but I&#x2019;m on the sidewalk, walking from here to there, the length of the stairs, and I&#x2019;m telling him a story real loud. Then Jessica, this girl in my eighth-grade class, walks by, and Jessica has the fattest ass. And she&#x2019;s like, Hey Jimmy, what&#x2019;s up? Then Kenny perks up. She stands in front of me and the way she moves from side to side, I know she&#x2019;s showing off for me. And I look at her and smile. I give her that papi smile. And in that instant, I&#x2019;ve moved from boy to man. I think of this bitch under me. I know who I&#x2019;m supposed to be. With Nene though, I know who I am. She starts laughing at whatever shit I tell her, and she glitters in the sun. In midlaugh, hers, Nene appears. His stepfather brought him down and barks at me to get his wheelchair. He leaves Nene at the bottom of the stoop, and I run upstairs. When I get back downstairs, I&#x2019;ve forgotten all about Jessica.</p> <p>***<br> I never realized how important words are until I see them fight. I watch them to see what it&#x2019;s like to be in a real grown-up relationship. They spend all their time in front of the TV now. No giggles coming from her bedroom. No desire to be together, alone with their love. When I come in, I sit in the living room with them because if they are going to fight, they&#x2019;ll do it with me watching. It won&#x2019;t matter. They won&#x2019;t notice that I&#x2019;m there. What they have to say to each other is much more important than me being there. I&#x2019;ve never seen so much of my mother before this summer, so much of her emotions. Sure, she&#x2019;s fought with her other boyfriends before this, but I&#x2019;ve never paid as much attention before. It held no interest for me. In the middle of their beefing, I look at the picture of them next to the TV. They&#x2019;re at a picnic, and he&#x2019;s hugging her from behind. The way they argue though it&#x2019;s like the fights they have on TV. It&#x2019;s like they don&#x2019;t have their own words. She says things like, How can you do this to me and don&#x2019;t you love me anymore? Her words may not be real, but I know her pain is. Even if her reaction is straight out of a soap opera. <br> I can see the arteries in her heart choking her. The way she can barely breathe and the tears streaming down her face. Cutting off her breath. <br> It almost breaks my heart. <br> He says things I&#x2019;ve heard before too: You make me do this. You&#x2019;re overreacting. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about. <br> I know what they&#x2019;re going to say so well I can almost mouth along and anticipate what their next words will be. And it seems like the same fight every few days. This time though she turns and punches the wall and leaves. And he does nothing that I don&#x2019;t expect him to do; he doesn&#x2019;t cry, he doesn&#x2019;t sit in a chair and try to talk to me about it. Nothing. He does what he is supposed to do. He yells some curses at the slammed door. And he leaves a few minutes later saying he doesn&#x2019;t need this shit. Then there is silence.</p> <p>***<br> In the middle of the summer, Kenny&#x2019;s mother goes to PR, and the first night she&#x2019;s gone, he invites me and Nene over. And a few girls. As soon as the girls get there, I start to get nervous. We sit on the living room floor and play spin the bottle. But the girl gets to decide where she is going to kiss the guy. Jessica spins first and she gets Kenny and kisses him on the cheek. Rebecca spins next and she gets Nene; she giggles nervously, stands up, and kisses him on the cheek. But when Jessica spins again, she gets me, and she takes me into Kenny&#x2019;s moms room and just keeps kissing and kissing me on the mouth. We both come out cheesing because everyone is looking at us. I look at Nene, but he looks beyond us.<br> As soon as the girls leave, Kenny turns to me and asks me what happened with Jessica. <br> &#x201c;Naw, nothing really happened. It was no big deal.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Yeah, tell us what happened,&#x201d; Nene chimes in before he turns around and goes down the hall to the bathroom.<br> &#x201c;No big deal? Is that why you had that kool-aid smile on your face? Come on man, tell us what happened. Did you touch her titties? Anything?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Naw, she was talking at first waiting for me to kiss her, then she must&#x2019;ve got tired of waiting and kissed me. She&#x2019;s cute, but you know, I&#x2019;m not really feeling her.&#x201d; <br> &#x201c;Nigga, are you gay? What&#x2019;s not to like? That bitch is fine.&#x201d; <br>By the time that Nene returns, Kenny has moved on and is telling me about him and Rebecca.</p> <p>We never speak about what we do. Our words come in the form of knots in our hearts, glances, and brief touches on the hot of my back. After the girls go home, we all go into Kenny&#x2019;s room to sleep. He has two twin beds, and Nene and I crawl into one. I know he won&#x2019;t touch me tonight because Kenny is here. But I can&#x2019;t sleep. He&#x2019;s so close to me. And I don&#x2019;t know if he will understand about Jessica. That there is no desire there. It&#x2019;s not so much mechanical, but I love the fact that I can kiss her in front of so many people. The flaunting of it. And when I let her kiss me, I think of Nene, and I wish she was him. That he could sit across from me, spin bottles, and that we could kiss in front of two, three, six people. He&#x2019;s asleep and his breath is against my neck, and it warms my entire body. I push against him, so I can feel the part of his lips on my back. And maybe this is as public as we can get.</p></p><h2>A Place Beyond Courage (William Marshal)</h2><p><p><b>Sometimes Keeping Your Honor Means Breaking Your Word</b></p><p>The early twelfth century is a time for ambitious men to prosper. John FitzGilbert is a man of honor and loyalty, sworn to royal service. When the old king dies, his successor rewards the handsome and ambitious John with castles and lands. But King Stephen has a tenuous hold on both his reign and his barons, and when jealous rivals at court seek to destroy John, he backs a woman's claim to the crown, sacrifices his marriage, and eventually is forced to make a gamble that is perhaps one step too far.</p><p>Rich with detail, masterful in its storytelling, <i>A Place Beyond Courage</i> is a tale of impossible gambles and the real meaning of honor.</p><p>"Picking up an Elizabeth Chadwick novel is like having a Bentley draw up at your door: you know you are in for a sumptouous ride."&#x2015;<i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>"The best writer of medieval fiction currently around."&#x2015;Richard Lee, founder and publisher, <i>Historical Novel Society</i></p><p>"A star back in Britain, Elizabeth Chadwick is finally getting the attention she deserves here."&#x2015;<i>USA Today</i></p></p><p>"A star back in Britain, Elizabeth Chadwick is finally getting the attention she deserves here,"-<em>USA Today</em>.

He cast his deputy a penetrating look from eyes the hue of shadowed water.</p> <p>"My lord?" A muscle ticked in the fleshy pouch beneath the man's left eye.</p> <p>Tresses of autumn sunlight swept across the rushes carpeting the great hall of King Henry's hunting lodge and trailed the edge of a trestle table, illuminating the lower third of a parchment covered in a scribe's swift scrawl. A strand of gold touched the back of John's hand and twinkled on the braid cuffing his tunic. "One's spavined, another's got mange, and the chestnut's old enough to have carried Moses out of Egypt!" He stabbed a forefinger at the offending entry on the exchequer roll. "It says here that Walter Picot renders five palfreys in payment of his debt to the King. If those creatures out there are palfreys, I'll salt my boots and eat them."</p> <p>"My lord, I-"</p> <p>"No excuses, Ralph. Return these sorry beasts to Picot and make him replace them with others fit to the description. If he refuses, report to me and I will deal with him. I'm not in the habit of giving house room to other men's leavings." Leaning back from the table, he laid his hand to his sword hilt in deliberate emphasis. As King Henry's marshal, he was responsible for discipline in the hall and a sword was part of his daily apparel rather than an accoutrement of ceremony and war. "Of course," he added, rubbing a reflective thumb over the smooth curve of the pommel, "if I find out that Walter supplied five good palfreys and someone has been using my absence from court to line his own purse by switching them for nags..." He let the sentence hang unfinished.</p> <p>Ralph licked his lips. "I am sure it is not the case, my lord."</p> <p>John raised a skeptical eyebrow. Leaning forward again, he placed his hand upon the parchment, arching long fingers over the words. "I expect absolute loyalty and competence from my men and I reward it generously. Play me false or let me down and I will find out-and if you live to regret it, you will be unfortunate. Understood?" John was barely five and twenty, but had won the right to be the King's marshal by more than heredity. Three years ago, he had defended a challenge to his position in trial by combat and settled the matter so convincingly that no one had questioned his abilities to fight or administrate since.</p> <p>"My lord, I will attend to the matter," Ralph answered, pale and set-lipped.</p> <p>"See that you do." John picked up the parchment and studied the next entry concerning quantities of bread for feeding the royal hounds. Usually he would have delegated the scrutiny of such lists to a subordinate but having been absent from court dealing with personal matters of estate in the wake of his father's death, he needed to stamp his authority on his office like a seal impressing warm wax.</p> <p>"Christ, how much bread does a dog-?" He stopped and looked up as a shadow blocked his light. "Sire?"</p> <p>"Never mind that," said Robert FitzRoy, Earl of Gloucester, standing over the trestle, arms folded, the sun streak now warming his blood-red tunic. "Come outside. There's something you need to see."</p> <p>John mentally sighed. It was pointless telling Gloucester he wanted to finish assessing these accounts before he went anywhere. As the King's eldest son, albeit bastard born, Gloucester wielded a powerful influence at court. It was in John's interests to be accommodating; besides, the man was a friend, ally, and sponsor.</p> <p>He pushed to his feet. Gloucester was tall, but John topped him by the length of an index finger, although the Earl's broader frame made them look much of a size. John picked his hat off the board and tucked it through his belt, thereby conceding he was unlikely to return to his accounts this side of the dinner hour.</p> <p>"My cousin Stephen has a new horse."</p> <p>Pinning his cloak, John stepped around the trestle. "Take those tallies to my chamber," he commanded over his shoulder to Ralph, "and I want to see the military service receipts for the months I've been gone. I'll expect a report on what's been done about that walking dog meat in the stables before noon tomorrow."</p> <p>"Yes, my lord." His deputy bowed, sweat beading his brow.</p> <p>John quickened his pace to catch up with Robert, his stride long and confident.</p> <p>"They know you're back," the latter remarked with amusement.</p> <p>Mordant humor curved John's lips. "They had better do."</p> <p>"You've found foul deeds hidden in the murk?"</p> <p>John's smile deepened, putting creases in his cheeks, showing where one day harder lines would develop. "Not as yet. Some questionable horses and dogs that appear to be eating best wheaten bread in suspicious quantities, but nothing I cannot handle."</p> <p>"And the women?"</p> <p>"Nothing I cannot handle there either."</p> <p>Robert laughed aloud and set his arm across John's shoulders. "I should hope not. Ah, it's good to have you back!"</p> <p>The courtyard was a churn of noisy, organized chaos, signaling the imminent departure of the hunt. Amid misty clouds of breath and pungent aromas of horse and stable, men were mounting up or conversing in groups as they waited for their grooms. Dogs snuffled underfoot, or, quivering with anticipation, strained on taut leashes. John observed the rib-serrated flanks of a white gazehound and thought about the accounts he had just been reading.</p> <p>A crowd had gathered to watch a ruddy fair-haired man putting a powerful roan stallion through its paces. Robert and John joined the group and stood with arms folded to watch the performance.</p> <p>"Spanish," John said with an appreciative eye and felt a twinge of envy. As the King's marshal, he owned fine horses himself but a beast of this caliber was too rich for his purse. However, it was standard fare for Stephen, Count of Mortain, King Henry's nephew and so high in favor that he was flying above most other folk at court. Not that Stephen was haughty with other men because of it. John had heard Henry's daughter, the Empress Matilda, remark with contempt that Stephen would drink water with the horses like a common groom rather than quaff wine out of a precious goblet as a man of his rank ought to do.</p> <p>Stephen made the horse rear and paw the air. A broad grin lit up his face and his eyes sparkled with pleasure. He brought the roan down to all fours and dismounted but only to spring back into the saddle facing backward. Then he scissored round to the fore and swept a flourish to his appreciative audience. He was so exuberant that it was impossible not to be caught up in his high spirits and John began to laugh and then applaud with the rest of the crowd.</p> <p>Gloucester cupped his hands to shout at Stephen, "Have you ever thought of performing such tricks for a living?"</p> <p>John glanced at the Earl, noting that his mirth was tinged with asperity. There was an edge of rivalry between Gloucester and his cousin Stephen. Both were magnates; both were close kin to the King. All the time they were slapping each other's backs and drinking together in the hall they were jostling for position and favor.</p> <p>"Many times!" Stephen called back cheerfully. He gathered the reins and settled the horse, patting its neck, tugging its ears. "But then I would lose the joy."</p> <p>"John has to earn his crust keeping the court concubines in order. I haven't seen any diminishing in his enthusiasm for the task, and it involves just as much sleight in the saddle as yours!" Robert retorted.</p> <p>Stephen gave a knowing grin. "I wouldn't dare to compete with the anvils and hammers of a royal marshal on that score!" he quipped, to the laughter of all, for everyone knew these were the time-honored symbols of a marshal as well as a euphemism for the male reproductive equipment. John's reputation in the latter department was somewhat notorious and he did nothing to play it down. Now he merely flourished a sardonic bow.</p> <p>Stephen's attention focused on a point beyond his audience. "The King is here," he said. "Best mount up or you'll be left behind." He nudged the roan toward a stocky, grizzle-haired man who had emerged from one of the lodging halls and was setting his foot to the stirrup of a handsome bay. A heavy gold clasp pinned his short hunting cloak at his shoulder. Two swaggering young men-Robert de Beaumont, Earl of Leicester, and his twin brother Waleran, Count of Meulan-accompanied him. They were Stephen's cronies and treated with suspicion by Robert of Gloucester because of their intimacy with his father the King. Meulan had proved a traitor in the past, but the King had forgiven him his transgressions and welcomed him back at court. Beaumont, the more circumspect of the two, cast an observant glance around as he took his courser's reins from a groom. John thoughtfully assessed their proximity to Henry. This was another area where he needed to focus following his absence. Every subtle change and nuance had to be taken into account in order to survive and advance at court.</p> <p>Stephen greeted them all with natural bonhomie. John thought-with further admiration for the Count of Mortain-that such ebullience was also a way of opening doors and disarming men of their caution.</p> <p>"You're riding out with us," Robert told John as he called up his mount and set his foot to the stirrup. "I've had your horse saddled." He snapped his fingers to a groom who led forward John's freckled gray courser.</p> <p>John tugged his hat from his belt and pulled it down over his blond-brown hair. "Thank you, my lord," he said with muted enthusiasm.</p> <p>Robert chuckled. "You don't mean it now." He tossed John a boar spear, which the latter caught mid-haft with a lightning reflex, "but you will in a while."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Cantering along a forest trail, the first autumn leaves glimmering from the trees in flakes of sunlit amber, the ground firm but springy under the gray's hooves, John realized Robert had been right. The powerful surge of his horse was exhilarating and the rich colors and deciduous scents of the autumn woods filled him with sensual pleasure.</p> <p>The King was hunting hard, pushing his horse and the dogs to their limit, his cloak bannering out behind him and his body curled over his mount's neck like a wave. The beaters flushed a boar from a thicket and Henry was after it like the devil in pursuit of a soul, one hand to the reins, the other hefting a spear. John spurred after him with the rest of the hunt, ducking under tree branches, forcing his way through thorny bramble thickets. The thud of hooves upon forest mulch, the belling of hounds, and the hard breath of his horse were a joy to his ears. Count Stephen pushed past him on his new roan, the Beaumont twins charging behind accompanied by the King's cup-bearer William Martel. Robert of Gloucester scoured their heels, his mouth set in grim determination. Prudently, John reined back and gave room to Henry's constable, Brian FitzCount, lord of Wallingford. John was his deputy in the household and careful to keep on his good side. FitzCount acknowledged John's courtesy with a fisted wave as he spurred on amid a flurry of dogs.</p> <p>The hunting horn sounded to John's left, but veered with the wind. He pivoted the gray toward it, but hastily drew on the rein and adjusted his grip on his spear as the undergrowth before him rustled with vigorous motion. An instant later three wild pigs broke from a deep thicket of bramble and ivy and charged past him so closely that his horse plunged and shied. He saw earth-smeared tushes, coarse rusty hair, and the moist gleam of snouts. Controlling his mount with the grip of his knees, he grasped the spear like a javelin and cast it with all his strength, piercing one of the boars behind the left shoulder to the full depth of the iron blade. The pig leaped and fell in a thresh of limbs and deafening squeals. The spear haft snapped off, leaving a bloody stump in the wound. John drew his sword and maneuvered the gray cautiously toward his victim. Even mortally injured, a wild boar was capable of eviscerating a dog and slashing a horse's leg to the bone. The boar struggled to rise, failed, shuddered, and was still.</p> <p>As John dismounted, the forest around him filled with running dogs, beaters, and huntsmen on foot. In the distance, a horn was blowing for another kill-probably acknowledging the King's success. He gazed at his own prize and, as a dog-keeper whipped the hounds to heel and his heartbeat slowed, he suddenly grinned like a youth.</p> <p>By the time the main hunt had turned back to investigate the second blowing of the mort, John was watching two beaters heave his prize across a pony's back.</p> <p>"You outdo us all," King Henry told him, his smile exposing a crowd of chipped, life-worn teeth. His own trophy dangled limply over a pack saddle.</p> <p>"Sire, I was fortunate and I had little choice."</p> <p>"Perhaps not, but it won't harm your reputation for being a dangerous man to cross. Anyone who tackles a boar on his own deserves whatever fate deals to him-in your case, John FitzGilbert, an accolade."</p> <p>"Thank you, sire," John replied with a grave bow. "Indeed, it was three," he added as he straightened, "but I am sorry to say that two escaped my spear and ran off in that direction."</p> <p>Henry laughed and his eyes shone with a huntsman's relish. "Then you have a grain of prudence and it leaves more for the chase." He gestured to his attendants and spurred off in the direction John had indicated, the hunting horn blowing the away.</p> <p>Stephen started to follow his uncle, but paused to lean down and slap John's shoulder. "Well done!" Genuine admiration gleamed in his blue eyes.</p> <p>"It was the heat of the moment," John said with modest dismissal.</p> <p>"Proves you don't need a Spanish horse to make an impression," Gloucester remarked acidly as he turned his own horse.</p> <p>Another boar and two roebuck later, the hunters stopped at a pre-arranged clearing to replenish their energy with the victuals the King's attendants had gone ahead to prepare.</p> <p>The hunting party f�ted and teased John for bringing down a boar single-handed. He shrugged off the praise because open boasting was not in his nature; nevertheless, he was quietly pleased.</p> <p>He was crouching by the fire pit, toasting a chunk of bread on a pointed stick, when Gloucester sauntered over to join him. "You know my sister is still in Rouen," he said casually after a moment.</p> <p>John turned the stick, drawing the bread a little away from the heat. "No sign of reconciliation between her and Geoffrey then?" Shortly before he had left court to attend to his dying father and the affairs of his estate, the King's daughter Matilda had quarreled with her new husband, the adolescent Geoffrey of Anjou. The youth had sent her home to Normandy, saying he refused to live with such a termagant, let alone bed with her and beget an heir.</p> <p>Robert turned his mouth down at the corners. "She's still saying that hell will freeze over before she'll go back to him and he's saying the same about having her back."</p> <p>"And your father?"</p> <p>"Gnashing his teeth in private but still striving for diplomacy. There's not a lot he can do without...</p></p><h2>The Berenstain Bears Out West (I Can Read Level 1)</h2><p><p><em>Yee-ha!</em> The Bear family is flying over rivers and mountains to get to Uncle Tex's ranch.

These are questions of crucial importance for contemporary biblical studies and theology alike.</p><p>Kevin Vanhoozer contends that the postmodern crisis in hermeneutics&#x2014;&#x201d;incredulity towards meaning,&#x201d; a deep&#x2013;set skepticism concerning the possibility of correct interpretation&#x2014;is fundamentally a crisis in theology provoked by an inadequate view of God and by the announcement of God&#x2019;s &#x201c;death.&#x201d;</p><p>Part 1 examines the ways in which deconstruction and radical reader&#x2013;response criticism &#x201c;undo&#x201d; the traditional concepts of author, text, and reading. Dr. Vanhoozer engages critically with the work of Derrida, Rorty, and Fish, among others, and demonstrates the detrimental influence of the postmodern &#x201c;suspicion of hermeneutics&#x201d; on biblical studies.</p><p>In Part 2, Dr. Vanhoozer defends the concept of the author and the possibility of literary knowledge by drawing on the resources of Christian doctrine and by viewing meaning in terms of communicative action. He argues that there is a meaning in the text, that it can be known with relative adequacy, and that readers have a responsibility to do so by cultivating &#x201c;interpretive virtues.&#x201d;</p><p>Successive chapters build on Trinitarian theology and speech act philosophy in order to treat the metaphysics, methodology, and morals of interpretation. From a Christian perspective, meaning and interpretation are ultimately grounded in God&#x2019;s own communicative action in creation, in the canon, and preeminently in Christ. Prominent features in Part 2 include a new account of the author&#x2019;s intention and of the literal sense, the reclaiming of the distinction between meaning and significance in terms of Word and Spirit, and the image of the reader as a disciple&#x2013;martyr, whose vocation is to witness to something other than oneself.</p><p><em>Is There a Meaning in This Text?</em> guides the student toward greater confidence in the authority, clarity, and relevance of Scripture, and a well&#x2013;reasoned expectation to understand accurately the message of the Bible. Is There a Meaning in This Text? is a comprehensive and creative analysis of current debates over biblical hermeneutics that draws on interdisciplinary resources, all coordinated by Christian theology. It makes a significant contribution to biblical interpretation that will be of interest to readers in a number of fields. The intention of the book is to revitalize and enlarge the concept of author&#x2013;oriented interpretation and to restore confidence that readers of the Bible can reach understanding. The result is a major challenge to the central assumptions of postmodern biblical scholarship and a constructive alternative proposal&#x2014;an Augustinian hermeneutic&#x2014;that reinvigorates the notion of biblical authority and finds a new exegetical practice that recognizes the importance of both the reader&#x2019;s situation and the literal sense.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>This monograph on hermeneutics is part of Foundations of Contemporary Interpretation (which has been reissued in one volume). A brilliant young evangelical scholar, Kevin Vanhoozer begins by giving the philosophical background to the history of the hermeneutical task. He then discusses modern approaches to hermeneutics, particularly those that insist that no meaning can be ascribed to a text. He goes on to build a strong case for a hermeneutic that insists that literary texts--particularly the Bible--do in fact convey a meaning that can be derived from he text. This book can rightly be called a theology of interpretation.Kevin Vanhoozer (Ph.D., Cambridge University) is senior lecturer in theology and religious studies at New College, University of Edinburgh, in Edinburgh, Scotland.

This book is unique because although the lojong teachings of the Kadam tradition are well known, this is the first time the mind-training teachings from the Dzogchen tradition have been presented in an English translation, and most Western scholars and practitioners are unaware that such mind-training techniques even exist in Dzogchen. The contemplations themselves are vividly described, and some unfold as dramatic stories in which the meditator imagines himself or herself as the main character. Thus, they are quite accessible for beginning practitioners.</p><p>"The sevenfold mind training of the Dzogchen lineage is very important, since it gives us a practical set of instructions to help us to get in touch with the fundamental wisdom of the Buddhist path. In ancient times, it was often said that these foundational teachings are even more important than the advanced instructions of our tradition. I am very happy to see these important texts now appearing in the English language. They will be of great benefit to all those interested in the path of awakening."--Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, author of <i>Turning Confusion into Clarity</i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>"The great vidya�dhara Jigme Lingpa left an abundance of literary and instructional treasures for us--methods for awakening our hearts and freeing our minds. Among those, the sevenfold mind-training instructions presented in The Steps to Liberation are an especially powerful set of teachings that unite many of the key points of sutra and tantra in an utterly pragmatic way. I am therefore very happy and grateful that Cortland Dahl has made an excellent translation of these precious teachings available to the English-reading public. I encourage readers to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to deepen and expand their compassion and wisdom."--Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, author of&nbsp;<i>Rebel Buddha: A Guide to a Revolution of Mind</i><b>Jigme Lingpa</b> (1730-1798) was one of the most important masters of the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. He and the great fourteenth-century master Longchen Rabjam (1308-1363), with whom he was closely linked through visionary experience, are known as the "two omniscient masters, father and son." Jigme Lingpa was a tert�n, or discoverer of treasure teachings, and revealed the Longchen Nyingtik, one of the most important cycles of meditative practice in the Nyingma School.<b>Cortland Dahl</b> is a Buddhist scholar and translator, a meditation teacher, and a collaborator on various scientific studies.

Yet most biographers pay little attention to people&#x2019;s attitudes toward food, as if the great and notable never bothered to think about what was on the plate in front of them. Once we ask how somebody relates to food, we find a whole world of different and provocative ways to understand her. Food stories can be as intimate and revealing as stories of love, work, or coming-of-age. Each of the six women in this entertaining group portrait was famous in her time, and most are still famous in ours; but until now, nobody has told their lives from the point of view of the kitchen and the table.&nbsp; <br><br><i>What She Ate</i> is a lively and unpredictable array of women; what they have in common with one another (and us) is a powerful relationship with food. They include Dorothy Wordsworth, whose food story transforms our picture of the life she shared with her famous poet brother; Rosa Lewis, the Edwardian-era Cockney caterer who cooked her way up the social ladder; Eleanor Roosevelt,&nbsp; First Lady and rigorous protector of the worst cook in White House history; Eva Braun, Hitler&#x2019;s mistress, who challenges our warm associations of food, family, and table; Barbara Pym, whose witty books upend a host of stereotypes about postwar British cuisine; and Helen Gurley Brown, the editor of <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, whose commitment to &#x201c;having it all&#x201d; meant having almost nothing on the plate except a supersized portion of diet gelatin.</p><p>Laura Shapiro has written on every food topic from champagne to Jell-O for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>, and many other publications. She is the author of three classic books of culinary history. Her awards include a James Beard Journalism Award and one from the National Women&#x2019;s Political Caucus. She&nbsp; has been a fellow at the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library, where she also co-curated the widely acclaimed exhibition <i>Lunch Hour NYC</i>.Eleanor had never wanted to be First Lady. She hated the idea of surrendering her independence and pulling back from hands- on political work just to become a hostess. For the sake of the country she was glad FDR had been elected, but she knew exactly what First Ladies did: they got dressed up, they shook hands, and they made small talk, day after endless day. How could she submit to such a role? When FDR was nominated, she was the only person in the room who was stone- faced; and when he won, she wrote later, &#x201c;The turmoil in my heart and mind was rather great that night, and the next few months were not to make any clearer what the road ahead would be.&#x201d; As she was organizing the household for the move to Washington, she made a tentative suggestion to FDR: Wasn&#x2019;t there &#x201c;a real job&#x201d; she could do in the White House? Perhaps answer some of his mail? &#x201c;He looked at me quizzically and said he did not think that would do, that Missy, who had been handling his mail for a long time, would feel I was interfering. I knew he was right and that it would not work, but it was a last effort to keep in close touch and to feel that I had a real job to do.&#x201d; Eventually, of course, she created that job. She had seen how home economics operated: it was a woman&#x2019;s profession in a man&#x2019;s world. No lines were crossed, no fiefdoms challenged, but the women gave heart and soul to work they cared about. Now she, too, set out to find a professional place for herself, even while confined to FDR&#x2019;s sphere. She couldn&#x2019;t set policy, but she could travel, meet people, listen to them, investigate, pull myriad strings in Washington, make brilliant use of symbolic gestures, and give speeches that heartened the poor, the exploited, and the powerless. As Blanche Wiesen Cook put it, &#x201c;Her vision shaped the best of his&nbsp; presidency&#x201d;&#x2014;an assessment that would have been supported overwhelmingly by the millions of Americans whose lives she touched, though Eleanor herself would have briskly turned away any such compliment.<br><br>Her first responsibility was one that FDR asked her to take on: he wanted her to manage the domestic side of the White House&#x2014;a notion that must have reverberated in his mind for the next twelve years like a howl of triumph from Satan himself. Eleanor promptly set out to locate a first- rate housekeeper, someone who would plan and oversee the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and marketing for what was, in effect, a private hotel under public scrutiny. She thought she knew just the right person. Back in 1928, when FDR was running for governor of New York, Eleanor had become involved with the Hyde Park branch of the League of Women Voters and met a local woman who was also active in it: Henrietta Nesbitt, a homemaker with two grown sons and an unemployed husband. She was a strong supporter of FDR&#x2019;s and went to the same Episcopal church as Eleanor. And her family was hard up. Eleanor saw a way to help. She began hiring Mrs. Nesbitt to bake bread, pies, coffee cakes, and cookies for the constant entertaining that was going on at Hyde Park, and when the Roosevelts moved to Albany Mrs. Nesbitt kept right on baking for them, sending the orders upstate by train. Then FDR ran for president and won. Mrs. Nesbitt was delighted but also a little disappointed. The baking had been &#x201c;a godsend,&#x201d; as she wrote in her memoir, <i>White House Diary</i>. Now it was coming to an end, and the Nesbitts, who had been forced to move in with their son and his family, were going to lose their only source of income. But shortly after Thanksgiving, Mrs. Roosevelt stopped by and said she was going to need a housekeeper in the White House. At the time she wrote her memoir, Mrs. Nesbitt was aware that her tenure in the White House was likely to be remembered as a national embarrassment&#x2014;she had read all the bad press and heard all the complaints&#x2014;and in her book she made a point of quoting Eleanor&#x2019;s job offer very precisely: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want a professional housekeeper. I want someone I know. I want you, Mrs. Nesbitt.&#x201d;<br><br> It&#x2019;s not clear why Eleanor was so determined to hire an amateur for a job that called for supervising more than two dozen employees, maintaining sixty rooms and their furnishings, preparing meals for a guest list that often doubled or tripled on short notice, feeding sandwiches and sweets to a thousand or more at tea on any given day, and making sure family members and their innumerable overnight guests had everything they might require around the clock. Eleanor&#x2019;s contacts in Washington, not to mention her friends in home economics, could have given her the names of many candidates far more experienced than Mrs. Nesbitt. But Eleanor was comfortable with this Hyde Park woman, so loyal and accommodating, whose pies and cookies always arrived at the house when they were supposed to, and who very much needed the work. Why look elsewhere?<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Nesbitt didn&#x2019;t know beans about running a White House,&#x201d; recalled Lillian Rogers Parks, who worked as a maid and seamstress for the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, the Trumans, and the Eisenhowers. Known backstairs as &#x201c;Fluffy&#x201d;&#x2014;because she was so very much the opposite&#x2014;Mrs. Nesbitt had neither the skills nor the temperament for the immense job she had taken on, and she met the situation by becoming officious, overbearing, and peremptory. The staff loathed her. J. B. West, the longtime White House usher, said the mansion began looking &#x201c;dingy, almost seedy&#x201d; under her care, and the kitchen saw plate after plate coming back with gray slices of meat and pallid vegetables barely touched. The president complained steadily about the food, and by 1944 he was saying that the main reason he wanted to win a fourth term was for the pleasure of firing Mrs. Nesbitt. But to the end of Eleanor&#x2019;s life, she insisted she had made a good hire. &#x201c;Father never told me he wanted to get rid of Mrs. Nesbitt,&#x201d; she claimed in a letter to her son James, who had described in a memoir FDR&#x2019;s vehement feelings about the housekeeper. She added that FDR &#x201c;often praised&#x201d; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s work&#x2014;an assertion so blatantly untrue that nobody took it seriously except Mrs. Nesbitt, who made the same claim in her own two books.<br><br>Yet Mrs. Nesbitt, the most reviled cook in presidential history, kept a careful record of the lunch and dinner menus she had planned at the White House and gave them to the Library of Congress with the rest of her papers. It&#x2019;s as if she wanted to announce to all future detractors that contrary to her reputation she had done a splendid job and fully deserved the faith that Eleanor had in her. Hence we have a comprehensive picture of what was served throughout FDR&#x2019;s administration&#x2014;not just the state dinners, which every administration publicized, but all the other meals as well. They make it clear, in fact they make it vivid, what everyone was so unhappy about.<br><br>Mrs. Nesbitt was under orders to practice strict economy, first because of the Depression and later because of wartime rationing. Beyond this, her only culinary vision was the one she had developed as a small- town home cook who occasionally ate out in modest restaurants. Eleanor looked over the menus every morning, but she was even less adventuresome than Mrs. Nesbitt when it came to feeding people and rarely asked for changes. Apart from this daily conference with the First Lady, Mrs. Nesbitt insisted on absolute control in the kitchen. &#x201c;Of course, Henrietta did not personally do the cooking, but she stood over the cooks, making sure that each dish was overcooked or undercooked or ruined one way or another,&#x201d; wrote Lillian Parks. Taste, texture, serving the food at the proper temperature, making sure each dish looked appetizing&#x2014;these were niceties that did not concern the housekeeper. For dinner she typically offered simple preparations of beef, lamb, chicken, and fish, though by the time they arrived at the table they tended to be cold and dried out. She also deployed an occasional novelty of the sort that appeared in women&#x2019;s magazines under such names as &#x201c;Seafood Surprise&#x201d; and &#x201c;Ham Hawaiian.&#x201d; Low- cost main dishes like sweetbreads, brains, and chicken livers appeared frequently, so frequently FDR took to complaining that he was never given anything else. But the greater cause for misery seems to have been lunch, which Mrs. Nesbitt saw as a fine occasion to save money. She built up a small repertoire of dishes based on leftovers and other inexpensive mixtures, and these turned up week after week as regularly as if they were on assignment. Sometimes these mixtures were stuffed into a green pepper, other times into a patty shell, but her favorite way to present them was the most straightforward&#x2014;on toast. There were curried eggs on toast, mushrooms and oysters on toast, broiled kidneys on toast, braised kidneys on toast, lamb kidneys on toast, chipped beef on toast, and a dish called &#x201c;Shrimp Wiggle,&#x201d; consisting of shrimp and canned peas heated in white sauce, on toast.<br><br>Another way to stretch just about any sort of food was to turn it into a creamed entr�e or side dish, so day after day the Roosevelts and their company encountered creamed codfish, creamed finnan haddie, creamed mushrooms, creamed carrots, creamed clams, creamed beef, and creamed sweetbreads. Egg dishes also appeared with some persistence: she offered stuffed eggs and shirred eggs, and she featured &#x201c;Eggs Benedictine&#x201d; until 1938, when somebody finally corrected her. Sometimes the menus make it clear that she was at wits&#x2019; end: we see her resorting to a dish she called &#x201c;Stuffed Egg Salad&#x201d; for two lunches in a row, and on another presumably frantic day it was sweet potatoes at both lunch and dinner. (She did vary them, adding marshmallows at lunch and pineapple at dinner.)<br><br>When it came to the salad course, Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s interpretation of the possibilities came from a long, uniquely American tradition in which any combination of foods, however unlikely, could be designated a salad simply by serving them on a lettuce leaf. &#x201c;We leaned on salads of every variety,&#x201d; she wrote in <i>The Presidential Cookbook,</i> her collection of White House recipes. &#x201c;Mrs. Roosevelt was especially fond of salads. . . .&nbsp; And even the men, who seemed inclined to frown on vegetables in any form, showed a definite interest in greens when they were fixed in appetizing ways with a tangy dressing.&#x201d; How the men reacted to &#x201c;Jellied Bouillon Salad&#x201d; is not recorded. Other salads that appeared on the White House table, and these must have made quite an impression on foreign visitors unfamiliar with the tradition, included &#x201c;Stuffed Prune Salad,&#x201d; &#x201c;Ashville Salad&#x201d; (canned tomato soup in a gelatin ring mold), and &#x201c;Pear Salad,&#x201d; a hot- weather specialty featuring canned pears covered in cream cheese, mayonnaise, chives, and candied ginger. Mrs. Nesbitt said she sometimes colored the mayonnaise green.<br><br>Many of these dishes reflected the American eating habits of her time; others would have been extreme under any circumstances. Not many families began dinner with sticks of fresh pineapple that had been rolled in crushed peppermint candy. But on the whole, Mrs. Nesbitt was setting a familiar if dowdy table, a culinary standard that suited Eleanor very well. She was emphatic about promoting simple, mainstream cuisine as a Roosevelt administration virtue. &#x201c;I am doing away with all the kickshaws&#x2014;no hothouse grapes&#x2014;nothing out of season,&#x201d; she told <i>The New York Times</i>. &#x201c;I plan for good and well- cooked food and see that it is properly served, and that must be enough.&#x201d; And perhaps it would have been, if Mrs. Nesbitt had been able to bring the right instincts or training to her work. She had little of either to draw upon. The arrival of foreign visitors was especially challenging, though she liked to think of herself as rising to the occasion. &#x201c;For Chinese people I&#x2019;d always try for a bland menu,&#x201d; she explained in <i>White House Diary</i>. &#x201c;Then for the Mexican dinner I&#x2019;d have something hot, like Spanish sauce with the chicken.&#x201d; She was especially proud of the nondairy, vegetarian menu she was able to create for the ambassador from Abyssinia and his entourage, who were Coptic Christians, and she carefully kept it on file to reuse when she had to feed Hindus or Muslims. Those who couldn&#x2019;t eat the clam cocktail or the bluefish presumably filled up on the Mexican corn.<br><br>A few of the meals in Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s collection are marked &#x201c;Mrs. Hibben&#x2019;s menu,&#x201d; a reference to a rare dalliance with gourmandise that took place early in the first administration. After the election, Eleanor received a memo from Ernestine Evans, a former journalist and peripatetic literary agent who took an interest in food and thought it could play a useful role in the new White House. Why not showcase American cooking? Menus could include fine regional dishes&#x2014;&#x201c;cornbreads and gumbos and chowders&#x201d;&#x2014;authentically prepared with local ingredients. Just as the White House regularly supplied the press with the names of the guests at official dinners, it could also supply the menus; and a commitment to focus on America&#x2019;s culinary traditions would assure positive news coverage. Evans said she had the right person in mind to help make this happen: Sheila Hibben, author of <i>The National Cookbook</i> and &#x201c;the best practical cook I know.&#x201d; Perhaps Hibben could work quietly behind the scenes in the White House kitchen for a few months, developing appropriate menus and recipes. &#x201c;She should be used like a good architect,&#x201d; Evans mused. &#x201c;She should go back and find out what Jefferson served, and be ready always with a great deal of lore, so that every dish has history as well as savor.&#x201d;<br><br>Sheila Hibben was a witty, cosmopolitan food writer who contributed regularly to <i>The New Yorker</i> and other chic magazines. In the introduction to <i>The National Cookbook,</i> she wrote that she had been inspired to start collecting regional American recipes the day she came across a picture in the Sunday paper of a bowl of soup topped with whipped cream&#x2014;whipped cream, that is, in the shape of a Sealyham terrier. Off she went on a mission to rescue what was still excellent in American cooking, hoping the best recipes would act as a kind of seawall to protect fine regional cookery against crashing waves of the idiotic, the reductionist, and the dreary. A project that began with indignation, she added, ended in patriotism&#x2014;&#x201c;a special sort of patriotism, a real enthusiasm for the riches and traditions of America.&#x201d; Eleanor liked the idea of food that could teach history, and she invited Hibben to visit the White House kitchen and share her ideas and recipes with Mrs. Nesbitt. Alas, there seems to be no record of precisely what happened when Mrs. Nesbitt met this particular challenge to her authority, but in the end, victory went to the housekeeper.<br><br>Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s most important adversary, however, wasn&#x2019;t in the kitchen; he was in the Oval Office. She and FDR were at odds from the start. &#x201c;Father, who would have been an epicure if he had been given the opportunity, began grumbling about the meals served under Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s supervision within a week of her reporting for duty,&#x201d; wrote his son Elliott in a memoir. &#x201c;Restricted in his wheelchair from dining out except on ceremonial occasions, he was at the mercy of Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s kitchen.&#x201d; FDR liked a decent fried egg in the morning; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s were invariably overcooked. He longed for a good cup of coffee; Mrs. Nesbitt&#x2019;s was bitter.

But it doesn&#x2019;t stop there. Wilson powerfully and astutely applies the message of Galatians to contemporary life. Galatians isn&#x2019;t left on the shelf; the Word addresses us as those who are tempted to walk according to the flesh, and we are reminded of what it means to be led by the Holy Spirit.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Thomas R.

While the poems are pleasant and evoke the images a child might have of weather and seasons, it is Hughes' realistic pictures which make this book. Readers not only come to know the seasons through natural data but also come to know the small narrator's family and her world. Children will enjoy watching for the narrator's baby brother, her parents, her cat and dog, and her special toys in the half-page watercolor paintings and the small detailed pictures which surround the text. Seasonal poems are clumped together and set off by a double-page spread which highlights people and their activities in each season. The busy spring pictures, full of people gardening, cleaning, and hanging out of windows to talk and enjoy the weather, evoke the sense of freedom of that season after a long winter. While the poems would work well in preschool story hour sessions on seasons, the detailed pictures cry out for a lap or occasions in which one or several children sit down and pore over the book.

She looked at the capitol building in the distance. Its sandstone dome towered over the other buildings in the city, as it had for the past 138 years. At one time, it was the capitol of a single state; now it was the capitol of her country, a country born out of chaos and destruction.</p><p>She tore her gaze away from the distance and looked down at the photo she held in her hand. She touched the faces of the family depicted. Tears began to well up in her eyes as she passed her fingers across the photo. It contained four smiling faces; a portrait of a once-happy family, her family. More tears came as she thought back to the day the picture was taken. She remembered it vividly, as though it was that very morning. Haley closed her eyes and pressed the photo against her chest; the tears ran down her cheeks and hung from her chin. She remembered her father holding her tight as she sat on his knee; he kissed her many times on her head and told her how proud he was that she had tied her own shoes that day. She longed for that innocent time when she had no concerns or cares. She longed for the days when her family was together and happy. Not long after that photo was taken, her innocent world collided with the harsh realities of mass murder and apocalypse. Her family was to be ripped apart by this new reality, and what remained would never be the same.</p><p>A knock at her front door jolted her back to present. She quickly wiped the tears from her face and placed the photo in the pocket of her sweater. She walked toward the front door, but before she opened it, she turned to the mirror that hung on the wall in the foyer and looked at herself. She made sure she had wiped all the tears away and fixed her graying hair.</p><p>&#x201c;You can do this, Haley,&#x201d; she said, attempting to reassure herself of the difficult task she had before her.</p><p>She turned and opened the door. On the porch before her were three people. The first was a man in his thirties, John, the lead reporter for the Cascadian Times. He was accompanied by two photographers, neither of whom could be more than twenty-five years old. They were all postwar babies; none of them knew the horror and brutality of the Great Civil War.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Rutledge?&#x201d; John asked as he reached his hand out.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, please call me Haley.&#x201d; She grasped his hand firmly and shook.</p><p>She greeted the other two and invited everyone into her house. They shared small talk as the photographers set up equipment for the photo shoot that would follow the interview.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Rutledge, when you&#x2019;re ready to begin, let me know,&#x201d; John said.</p><p>&#x201c;John, please, call me Haley.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; he answered with a sheepish grin.</p><p>Haley sat nervously, her hands rigidly clasped on her lap. She rubbed her fingers in anticipation of the first question.</p><p>&#x201c;Haley, first let me thank you for letting us into your home. It is an honor to be able to speak with you and to get your personal story and perspective.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very welcome, John. I have to admit, I&#x2019;m a bit nervous. As you know, I don&#x2019;t like the limelight nor have I ever been one for doing interviews. If it weren&#x2019;t for your family connection you wouldn&#x2019;t be here. I knew your father; he was a friend and colleague to my own father. It was only when I heard you would be the one conducting this interview that I agreed,&#x201d; Haley said. She sat very straight and looked at John directly.</p><p>&#x201c;I do know that our families have had some connection in the past and, again, thank you. Let me then get right into this.&#x201d;</p><p>Haley just nodded her approval.</p><p>&#x201c;Next week marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty of Salt Lake. It was that treaty that gave our young republic the formal victory over our opponents and gave birth to our country. Your father was in Salt Lake for that signing. What can you tell me about him?&#x201d;</p><p>Haley chuckled a bit before she answered. &#x201c;Wow, that is quite the question. What can I tell you about my father? Where do I begin?&#x201d; She paused for a moment before she continued, &#x201c;Are you asking me about how he was then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see how that can be a vague question, I&#x2019;m sorry. Let me start again. Your father was very instrumental in the founding of this country; he is one of our founding fathers, as some would say. While many praise him for his sacrifice, there are some now that question some of his actions during the Great Civil War. How would you describe him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have heard some of those revisionists who now, in the protection of our hard-fought freedom, question the means by which it was gained. To them I say, &#x2018;you didn&#x2019;t live it, you were not there.&#x2019; It is easy to sit in the comfort of liberty handed to you, swaddled in the bloodied cloth of our revolution,&#x201d; Haley said firmly. &#x201c;If you are here to question my father&#x2019;s actions, then I feel we should start with who my father was and where he came from. The man I knew was a loving and protective man. He cared for me and the rest of his family and was willing to do whatever it took to ensure our survival. Many look back on history without looking at context. You have to have lived it to truly understand why anyone did what they did. My father was a pragmatic man who took direct action when it benefitted those whom he pledged to protect. He was not always a pragmatist, though.&#x201d; Haley paused; she shifted in her seat and then continued with a softer tone in her voice. &#x201c;Daddy was very open about his life. He told me stories from his past. Many times, he told me that life will show up and change the way you look at the world; that there would be incidents that would shake you to the core and shift your way of thinking. My daddy had a few of those moments, the first one I can remember him telling me happened back when he was a Marine in Iraq. What happened there changed him as a person and set him on the course that would lead us to this living room today. I hope you planned on being here a while, because I am going to set the record straight.&#x201d;</p><br><p>November 16, 2004</p><p>&#x201c;Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Marine General James Mattis to his Marines in Iraq</p><p>Fallujah, Iraq</p><p>&#x201c;Target acquired!&#x201d; yelled Sergeant Gordon Van Zandt, his face planted firmly on the day sight of the TOW antitank missile system.</p><p>Gordon could hear gunfire cracking around him. He focused on the target he had acquired, a small window. Inside, an Iraqi sniper was pinning down a squad of Marines further up the road. The glint of the sniper&#x2019;s scope and an occasional flash from the muzzle gave away the sniper&#x2019;s position.</p><p>After the pinned-down squad was notified that no air support was available, Gordon&#x2019;s TOW squad was called up to take out the sniper&#x2019;s nest. TOWs had been initially designed to destroy armored vehicles; the previous Gulf War had proven their farther-ranging battlefield application, bunker busting.</p><p>Gordon steadied his breathing and kept the crosshairs on the target while his driver, Lance Corporal Bivens, crouched outside the vehicle, alongside the rear driver&#x2019;s side with his SAW machine gun against his shoulder.</p><p>Bivens yelled, &#x201c;Back blast area all secure!&#x201d; Bivens was not your poster model of a Marine physique. He was small in stature, lean, and only stood around five feet six inches. But his nickname, &#x201c;Pit Bull,&#x201d; said more about him than anything else could; he was a staunch fighter and had proven himself a worthy opponent in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Immediately, Gordon reached up with his right hand, lifted the arming lever, and shouted back, &#x201c;Gun up!&#x201d;</p><p>He placed his hands gently back on the traversing unit&#x2019;s control knobs and with his right thumb flipped up the trigger guard.</p><p>Just then, he saw the sniper&#x2019;s rifle barrel emerge from the shadows of the small room he occupied. Not willing to waste another second, Gordon yelled out, &#x201c;Fire in the hole!&#x201d;</p><p>He pressed down on the trigger.</p><p>A loud pop and whiz came from the TOW. Within a couple of seconds the loud blast of the missile leaving the tube on its way to the target rattled Gordon&#x2019;s ears. He tracked the missile through his sight as it flew to its target. After only a few moments, he saw a flash of light. The missile had struck its target. All Gordon could see now was dark smoke billowing out of the room.</p><p>&#x201c;Impact, target destroyed!&#x201d; he yelled out. He reached up, released the bridge clamp unlocking the missile, and tossed the empty tube onto the ground.</p><p>Bivens slung his SAW and quickly opened the Hummer&#x2019;s rear hatch. He grabbed a new missile and handed it to Gordon, who loaded it into the launch tube with precision speed and closed the bridge clamp down. He jumped behind the scope, assessed the damage, and looked for more targets.</p><p>After feeling secure, he looked up from the gun and shouted out to Bivens, &#x201c;We got that fucking Muj, jump back in, and let&#x2019;s drive up to assist the grunts.&#x201d;</p><p>Bivens jumped back into the driver&#x2019;s seat and proceeded toward the Marine squad.</p><p>&#x201c;Bivens, radio the Battalion Forward HQ and order a medevac.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Bivens replied, grabbing the radio.</p><p>Bivens and Gordon pulled up to the Marines.</p><p>Grabbing his M-4 rifle, Gordon jumped off the top of the Hummer. He looked back to Bivens. &#x201c;Stand watch while I attend to these guys.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Roger that,&#x201d; Bivens replied as he crawled up into the hatch.</p><p>Gordon saw before him chunks of building, combat gear, and discarded weapons. Amongst the debris he also found eleven Marines, some battered and bloody. Some were sitting up against the wall of a building in an alleyway, but others just lay on the ground motionless. He couldn&#x2019;t tell if they were dead or not. Gordon could remember the first time he took fire; the sights of destruction and death were surreal then. Now, they had become commonplace.</p><p>Gordon approached the first Marine, knelt down, and asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your condition?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shot in the gut. This really fucking sucks,&#x201d; the wounded lance corporal muttered.</p><p>&#x201c;Listen. We&#x2019;ll get you out of here soon,&#x201d; Gordon assured him as he lifted up the bandage on the first Marine&#x2019;s stomach.</p><p>&#x201c;Corpsman? How&#x2019;s it looking here?&#x201d; Gordon shouted over to the Navy corpsman attending to another wounded Marine.</p><p>&#x201c;Much easier without that fucking Hajji shooting at us,&#x201d; the corpsman responded while bandaging another Marine.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks for blasting that Muj. You were a godsend,&#x201d; a second Marine told Gordon as he walked over.</p><p>Gordon looked up at the second Marine and noticed blood running down his leg and all over his left arm.</p><p>&#x201c;How you holding up?&#x201d; Gordon asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Shit, Sergeant, I&#x2019;ve seen better days, but I&#x2019;ll live.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, man. Who&#x2019;s in charge here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it was Corporal Davies, but the sniper took him down first. A shot through the head,&#x201d; the second Marine explained, gesturing toward his squad leader&#x2019;s lifeless body lying in the alleyway.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your unit?&#x201d; Gordon asked.</p><p>&#x201c;First Squad, third platoon, India Company, three-one, Sergeant, and I&#x2019;m Lance Corporal Smith. Just call me Smitty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Sergeant Van Zandt, Weapons, three-one, nice to meet you, Devil Dog,&#x201d; Gordon said, patting Smitty on his good shoulder.</p><p>Gordon proceeded to check on each wounded Marine. The Marines of Third Battalion, First Marines had been fighting their way toward their objective for almost ten days now. The fight was tough, but these men were Marines. Even though they had suffered casualties they were determined. The Thundering Third would reach their objective or die trying. However, dying wasn&#x2019;t an option for any of these Marines; it was their job to ensure it was the enemy who died for his cause.</p><p>Gordon came upon a Marine who was severely wounded; he dropped to one knee and examined the man&#x2019;s wounds. Gordon could tell from the markings on his bloody uniform that the man was a private first class; he couldn&#x2019;t be any older than twenty. Gordon couldn&#x2019;t help but make the grim prediction that this young Marine probably wouldn&#x2019;t see his twenty-first birthday. Gordon grabbed the Marine&#x2019;s hand and asked, &#x201c;How you doing, Marine?&#x201d;</p><p>Without opening his eyes, the young PFC whispered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m cold . . . very cold.&#x201d;</p><p>Gordon could see the large pool of blood collecting under the wounded Marine. He bent down to his ear and whispered, &#x201c;We got the fucker that did this and we&#x2019;ll get you out of here soon, I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>A Hummer rumbled to a stop in front of the squad. Two Marines sprung from the rear doors, stretcher in hand and ran to the wounded Marines. One by one, they loaded the most critical into the vehicle.</p><p>Just as they began backing away from the scene, a black streak from the south soared toward the Hummer and struck its cab. The explosion knocked Gordon to the ground.</p><p>Gordon opened his eyes. He wasn&#x2019;t sure how long he had been unconscious. The yelling, screaming, and gunfire seemed strangely faint and distant. His eyes burned; all he could see was deep black smoke billowing over him. He tried to get up, but intense pain shot up his back.</p><p>&#x201c;Goddamn it!&#x201d; he screamed. He took a deep breath and forced himself to sit up. His movements were slow, but he knew he needed to get up and start doing something. He looked around and found Bivens behind the TOW, scanning the area. The burning chassis and four smoldering tires of the ambulance were still there, but not much else. All on board were definitely dead; he could make out two burning corpses in the front seats. The charred bodies were slumped over, flames dancing out of their open mouths.</p><p>He saw the squad&#x2019;s remaining Marines taking cover and engaging something down the street. Gordon rose to his feet, balanced himself, and headed toward his Hummer.</p><p>&#x201c;Bivens, if you got a shot, take it!&#x201d; he commanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing, Sergeant. My visibility is not that great with all the smoke. Wait a minute . . . I see the fucker. Target acquired!&#x201d;</p><p>Gordon looked to the rear of the TOW. He didn&#x2019;t see anyone and yelled back, &#x201c;Back blast area all secure!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gun up,&#x201d; Bivens hollered, and not a second later he bellowed, &#x201c;Fire in the hole!&#x201d;</p><p>After its familiar pop and whiz, the missile propelled out of the tube. Almost instantly, it reached its target, a minaret of a mosque. The missile struck the minaret squarely, and it crumbled and fell to the ground.</p><p>The Marines cheered, but the engagement wasn&#x2019;t over. They had taken out the insurgent in the minaret, but were still taking small arms fire from the mosque.</p><p>Gordon and Bivens worked to get the TOW back up while the remnants of First Squad were engaging, slowly eliminating the Iraqi hostiles holed up inside the mosque.</p><p>As Gordon and Bivens readied the TOW for more action, the second vehicle in his team pulled up. Gordon looked up to Corporal Nellis, who was manning the &#x201c;Ma Deuce&#x201d; .50-caliber machine gun affixed atop the Hummer.</p><p>&#x201c;We have some Muj in the mosque that is located on the left about a block and a half down. Provide support with the fifty to the grunt squad,&#x201d; he instructed Nellis before running back to his vehicle to grab a radio.</p><p>He contacted Battalion Forward Headquarters to request additional support ...</p></p><h2>A New Breed: Satellite Terrorism in America</h2><p>You won&#39;t be able to stop reading once you pick up Dr. John Hall&#39;s terrifying account, A New Breed: Satellite Terrorism in America.

With special emphasis on vision Searle explains how the raw phenomenology of perception sets the content and the conditions of satisfaction of experience. The central question concerns the relation between the subjective conscious perceptual field and the objective perceptual field. Everything in the objective field is either perceived or can be perceived. Nothing in the subjective field is perceived nor can be perceived precisely because the events in the subjective field consist of the perceivings , whether veridical or not, of the events in the objective field.<br><br>Searle begins by criticizing the classical theories of perception and identifies a single fallacy, what he calls the Bad Argument, as the source of nearly all of the confusions in the history of the philosophy of perception. He next justifies the claim that perceptual experiences have presentational intentionality and shows how this justifies the direct realism of his account. In the central theoretical chapters, he shows how it is possible that the raw phenomenology must necessarily determine certain form of intentionality. Searle introduces, in detail, the distinction between different levels of perception from the basic level to the higher levels and shows the internal relation between the features of the experience and the states of affairs presented by the experience. The account applies not just to language possessing human beings but to infants and conscious animals. He also discusses how the account relates to certain traditional puzzles about spectrum inversion, color and size constancy and the brain-in-the-vat thought experiments. In the final chapters he explains and refutes Disjunctivist theories of perception, explains the role of unconscious perception, and concludes by discussing traditional problems of perception such as skepticism.<br></p><p><br><strong>John R. Searle</strong> is Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. His previous publications include <em>Making the Social World </em>(2010) and <em>Mind: A Brief introduction</em> (2004), both from Oxford University Press.<br><br>"...[O]ffers a straightforward, realistic account of how one perceives objects and states of affairs... Highly recommended." --<em>Choice</em> <br><p></p><br>"Immensely refreshing." --<em>The Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"<em>Seeing Things As They Are</em> is full of interesting ideas. It is engagingly written, and deals with big questions about the mind-world relations and the relation between the phenomenology and intentionality of perception. I recommned it to anyone interested in what makes perceptual contact with a mind-independent world possible." <br>-- <em>The Philosophers's Magazine</em> <br><p></p><br>"Searle's book is a wonderful addition to the philosophical discipline of perception, and a useful way for someone who is not well versed in the subject to receive and extensive overview of the historical arguments. The overarching thesis is a strong defense of Direct Realism that will inspire the reader to contemplate the ways they discern meaning through experience." -- <em>Englewood Review of Books</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Quantum Physics, Third Edition</h2><p><p>Since the publication of the first edition over 35 years ago, <b><i>Quantum Physics</i></b> has been one of the standard quantum mechanics texts for undergraduate physics majors.

In this groundbreaking study, Joshua M. Epstein and Robert L. Axtell approach this age-old question with cutting-edge computer simulation techniques. Such fundamental collective behaviors as group formation, cultural transmission, combat, and trade are seen to "emerge" from the interaction of individual agents following simple local rules.<br>In their computer model, Epstein and Axtell begin the development of a "bottom up" social science. Their program, named Sugarscape, simulates the behavior of artificial people (agents) located on a landscape of a generalized resource (sugar). Agents are born onto the Sugarscape with a vision, a metabolism, a speed, and other genetic attributes. Their movement is governed by a simple local rule: "look around as far as you can; find the spot with the most sugar; go there and eat the sugar." Every time an agent moves, it burns sugar at an amount equal to its metabolic rate. Agents die if and when they burn up all their sugar. A remarkable range of social phenomena emerge. For example, when seasons are introduced, migration and hibernation can be observed. Agents are accumulating sugar at all times, so there is always a distribution of wealth.<br>Next, Epstein and Axtell attempt to grow a "proto-history" of civilization. It starts with agents scattered about a twin-peaked landscape; over time, there is self-organization into spatially segregated and culturally distinct "tribes" centered on the peaks of the Sugarscape. Population growth forces each tribe to disperse into the sugar lowlands between the mountains. There, the two tribes interact, engaging in combat and competing for cultural dominance, to produce complex social histories with violent expansionist phases, peaceful periods, and so on. The proto-history combines a number of ingredients, each of which generates insights of its own. One of these ingredients is sexual reproduction. In some runs, the population becomes thin, birth rates fall, and the population can crash. Alternatively, the agents may over-populate their environment, driving it into ecological collapse.<br>When Epstein and Axtell introduce a second resource (spice) to the Sugarscape and allow the agents to trade, an economic market emerges. The introduction of pollution resulting from resource-mining permits the study of economic markets in the presence of environmental factors.<br>This study is part of the 2050 Project, a joint venture of the Santa Fe Institute, the World Resources Institute, and the Brookings Institution. The project is an international effort to identify conditions for a sustainable global system in the middle of the next century and to design policy actions to help achieve such a system.</p><p><i>Growing Artificial Societies</i> is a groundbreaking book that posits a new mechanism for studying populations and their evolution. By combining the disciplines of cellular automata and "artificial life", Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell have developed a mechanism for simulating all sorts of emergent behavior within a grid of cells managed by a computer. In their simulations, simple rules governing individuals' "genetics"" and their competition for foodstuffs result in highly complex societal behaviors. Epstein and Axtell explore the role of seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease or even "culture" within their artificial world, using these results to draw fascinating parallels with real- world societies. In their simulation, for instance, allowing the members to "trade" increases overall well-being but also increases economic inequality. In <i>Growing Artificial Societies</i>, the authors provide a workable framework for studying social processes in microcosm, a thoroughly fascinating accomplishment.Growing Artificial Societies is a milestone in social science research. It vividly demonstrates the potential of agent-based computer simulation to break disciplinary boundaries. It does this by analyzing in a unified framework the dynamic interactions of such diverse activities as trade, combat, mating, culture, and disease. It is an impressive achievement.&#39;</p><h2>Advertising by Design: Generating and Designing Creative Ideas Across Media</h2><p><b>A real-world introduction to advertising design in today's industry</b> <p><i>Advertising by Design</i> is the most comprehensive, up-to-date guide to concept generation and design for advertising.

Hawthorne, by birth and education, was instilled with the Puritan belief in America's limitless promise. Yet - in part because of blemishes on his own family history - he also saw the darker side of the young nation. Like his twentieth-century heirs William Faulkner and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hawthorne peered behind propriety's fa�ade and exposed the true human condition.</p><p>Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

She defines and models rhetorical listening, addressing identifications with gender and whiteness within public debates, scholarship, and pedagogy. Offering an approach grounded in classical rhetorical theory, Heideggerian theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, Ratcliffe presents rhetorical listening as an invention tactic that engages spoken and written texts and supplements reading, writing, speaking, and silence as a rhetorical art.</p><p>Theorizing intersections of gender and whiteness, <i>Rhetorical Listening </i>examines how whiteness functions as an "invisible" racial category and provides disciplinary and cultural reasons for the displacement of listening and for the use of rhetorical listening as a code of cross-cultural conduct. Ratcliffe presents rhetorical listening in terms of cultural logics, stances, and dominant interpretive tropes. She highlights the modern identification theory of Kenneth Burke and the postmodern identification and disidentification theory of Diana Fuss and presents nonidentification as a more productive site for rhetorical listening.</p></p><p><b>Krista Ratciffe</b> is an associate professor of English and the director of the First-Year English Program at Marquette University. The author of <i>Anglo-American Feminist Challenges to the Rhetorical Traditions: Virginia Woolf, Mary Daly, and Adrienne Rich </i>and coauthor of <i>Who&#x2019;s Having This Baby? Perspectives on Birthing, </i>she has written numerous journal articles on feminism and rhetoric.<p></p><p>The art of listening has been long forgotten in the study and teaching of rhetoric, according to Krista Ratcliffe in her 2005 book on rhetorical listening. Historically, the spoken word has played a significant role in conveying ideas, but Ratcliffe contends contemporary U.S. American culture has become dependent on the visual, such as images, reading, and writing. The role of listening, however, has not figured prominently in either contemporary or historical western thought. Ratcliffe's book on rhetorical listening offers insights about the value and possibilities for listening through identifications, disidentifications, and non-identifications. Ratcliffe's primary examples of listening in public debate, scholarly dis�course, and pedagogy are of particular interest to argumentation scholars. Given the number of controversial issues related to race and gender in contemporary U.S. American culture, <i>Rhetorical Listening </i>is also important for discussing these race- and gender-based topics. Examples such as the discourse surrounding the 2008 bids of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obarna for president of the United States, the 2009 Henry Louis Gates, Jr., beer summit with President Mama, the 2010 controversy over the firing of Shirley Sherrod at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the controversy over the Islamic cultural center in New York City, and Dr. Laura Schlessinger's use of race-based slurs on her radio program are just a few recent controversies that illustrate the continued relevance of Ratcliffe's book.</p><p>Ratcliffe defines rhetorical listening as "a trope for interpretative invention and as a code of cross-cuItural conduct . . . [which] signifies a stance of openness that a person may choose to assume in relation to any person, text, or culture" (p. 1). To illustrate what she means by this definition, she focuses on gender and race cultural logics to explore how we might invoke listening to create better cross-cultural relationships. She argues that we can use understandings of identification from Kenneth Burke, Diana Fuss, and others to establish a definition of rhetorical listening that emphasizes identification through commonalities <i>and </i>differences. In the introduction and first chapter, Ratcliffe explains the difficulties of simul�taneously focusing on similarities and differences, especially in the context of discussing race and gender. Specifically, understanding whiteness in U.S. American culture can lead to dysfunctional conversations based on our lack of accountability and sense of history in such discussions. Ratcliffe outlines the complicated nature of understanding both gender and race in historical contexts, and how that past informs our present meanings. She proposes that we use rhetorical listening as a way to engage metonymically the coexistence of differing ideas. According to Ratcliffe, rhetorical listening functions as a trope for understanding self and other, developing a sense of accountability, and establishing identifications across similarities and differences.</p><p>In the second chapter, Ratcliffe defines identification, using the works of Sigmund Freud, Kenneth Burke, Diana Fuss, and Judith Butler. Freudian identification is the interaction of the ego/id and self/other, whereas for Burke, identification is a 'place where conscious and unconscious rhetorical exchanges transpire (p. 49) or a place to develop consubstantiality, or common ground. Using Fuss's work, Ratcliffe describes identification as a "place where the boundaries between the personal and the political become inextricably and inexplicably intertwined, where the 'detour through the other that defines a self' occurs" (p. 49, quoting Fuss). The problem that Ratcliffe sees in these understandings of identification is that they emphasize or focus on the similarities rather than differences that exist between people, texts, and cultures. Understanding identification metaphorically, that is, to focus on the similarities, erases or minimizes important differences especially in gender and race discussions, accord�ing to Ratcliffe.</p>Rather than using metaphor to explore identifications in rhetorical listening, Ratcliffe proposes that we use metonym instead. A metonymic approach to identification and rhetorical listening focuses on the places where identification does not seem to exist, or what Ratcliffe calls disidentifications and non-identifications. Disidentification refers to "an iden�tification that has already been made and denied in the unconscious" (Fuss citing Judith Butler, p. 62). In this sense, disidentification requires a focused and conscious effort to rhetorically listen because of the potential implications of refusing or denying identification with another person, text, or culture. Non-identification signifies a place where identification does not necessarily occur, but rather exists as a gap or contradiction in discourse. Ratcliffe calls non-identification a"margin between"... [that] provide[s] a place of pause, a place of reflection, a place that invites people to admit gaps exist. Admissions of gaps may take the form of "I don't know you," "I don't know what I don't know about you," or even "I don't know that I don't know that you exist"&#x2014;whether that <i>yea </i>is a person, place, thing, or idea. In some cases, rhetorical listening in the place of non-identification may precede new identifications; in other cases it enables us to revisit former identifications and disidentifications. (p. 73)&nbsp;Metonym, because of its focus on non-identifications, creates places for productive rhetorical listening. Rhetorical listening then, is the process of engaging in a ethical stance in which "a listener must be imagined with an agency that enables him or her to <i>choose </i>to act ethically, either by listening and/or by acting upon that listening. . . given this agency, listeners must be provided with a lexicon and tactics for listening and acting upon their listening" (p. 76).<p>The final three chapters of Ratcliffe's book describe three areas in which rhetorical listening might be productive: public discussions, academic discourse, and pedagogy. In chapter three, she uses as an example an exchange between two prominent feminist scholars, Mary Daly and Andre Lorde, who seemed to disagree about the representation of African women in Daly's book, <i>Gyn/ecology. </i>Although Mary Daly passed away in January 2010, the seeming bitterness of the exchange between Daly and Lorde is prevalent in other discourses on the intersectionality of race, gender, ethnicity, class, and sexuality; this exchange and Ratcliffe's analysis serve as an excellent example for those writing and speaking about such intersectionalities. Ratcliffe contends that their exchange created a dysfunctional silence through using negative terms, masking commonalities and differences among women, and employing language of denial, defensiveness, and guilt/blame. The ensuing silence that followed their exchange is just one example of public discourse about race and gender that obscures ideologies about race and gender in our discourses. Rhetorical listening might be used to counter this dysfunctional silence through the engagement of terms, recognition of similarities and differences, and logics of accountability. One of Ratcliffe's more important points is that we need to move away from right/wrong and either/or type arguments, meaning that both sides of an argument might be valid or originate from different cultural logics that are difficult to compare.</p><br><p>According to Ratcliffe, scholarly discourses also result in similar silences, as she docu�ments in chapter four. She explores how academicians might listen in on conversations in various disciplines, using the concept of eavesdropping. Rather than signifying a "busybodi�ness," Ratcliffe defines eavesdropping as listening by "choosing to stand outside .. in an uncomfortable spot . . . on the border of knowing and not knowing .. . granting others the inside position . .. listening to learn" (pp. 104-5). A major concern for Ratcliffe is that as scholars we need to take into account how history influences our present, or what she calls "the then-that-is-now," using Heidegger's concept of circling through time (pp. 107-8), and Toni Morrison's concept of rememory that "signifies the embodied circling of time via identifications and disidentifications" (p. 109). In essence, Ratcliffe contends that we can and should eavesdrop on scholarly discourses to better understand ourselves and others. We can also eavesdrop on ourselves, "and then act upon our hearings" (p. 131).</p><p>In the final chapter, Ratcliffe connects rhetorical listening to pedagogy, in that professors can learn from their students through listening to their perspectives, and also can become better teachers by hearing how their students participate in certain kinds of discourses. Specifically, she addresses how students (and teachers) resist discussions about race and gender through denial, dismissal, defensiveness, non-productive guilt, and adherence to gender/color blind ideals (p. 138-9). She provides several suggestions for listening to these types of resistance and responding in ways that foster more productive discussions, paper assignments, and self-reflections. The appendix of the book includes course activities for discussing and writing about whiteness that many professors may find useful.</p><p>In sum, Ratcliffe's book offers a rich and interesting discussion about identifications, disidentifications, and non-identifications in rhetorical listening. She addresses a concept that has been little explored in rhetorical or argumentation studies, and clearly warrants further investigation both academically and pedagogically. The strengths of the book include its well-developed explanation of identification and its connection to rhetorical listening, em�phasizing a metonymic approach that emphasizes both commonalities and differences, and the recognition in discourses of gaps, contradictions, and places of non-identification. Ratcliffe's examples facilitate understanding of how rhetorical listening might be used in argument, discourse, and pedagogy, particularly to understand contemporary controversies related to race, gender, class, and ethnicity.</p><p>Stacey K.

Stories are what we use to make sense of the world. But how does this work? </p><p>In <i>Making Stories</i>, the eminent psychologist Jerome Bruner examines this pervasive human habit and suggests new and deeper ways to think about how we use stories to make sense of lives and the great moral and psychological problems that animate them. Looking at legal cases and autobiography as well as literature, Bruner warns us not to be seduced by overly tidy stories and shows how doubt and double meaning can lie beneath the most seemingly simple case.</p></p><p>Jerome Bruner was University Professor at New York University.Scientific discoveries regarding the functions of the brain have led some to question whether it might eventually be possible to substitute technical explanations for the stories and narratives that have traditionally been used to understand experience. Contrary to that view, and to the opinions he expressed in his 1962 book On Knowing, psychologist Bruner argues here that storytelling has an essential importance that cannot be replaced by science. While his conclusion may be valid, Bruner only weakly attempts to support his new point of view in this brief but rambling and disjointed essay. Beginning with a meandering discussion of the practical value of story through numerous literary references from Aristotle to Proust, Bruner offers a portrait of the historical function of narrative that speaks to the basic similarity of literature and science, i.e., that through the depiction of imagined worlds, stories like scientific hypotheses help people adapt to unexpected events. Bruner then considers the place of narrative in law and the "construction" of the self, ultimately suggesting that stories cannot be replaced by scientific explanation because stories are essential to our capacity to truly understand one another. Bruner cites the evidence that physicians who fail to listen to their patients' stories often fail to provide the correct treatment, despite knowing all the relevant medical facts. Regrettably, Bruner does not explain why this is the case i.e., why physicians cannot simply ignore their patients' narratives. Written for a general audience, this book takes on an inherently interesting subject, but lacks the care and focus its treatment requires. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Madness: A Brief History</h2><p>Looking back on his confinement to Bethlem, Restoration playwright Nathaniel Lee declared: "They called me mad, and I called them mad, and damn them, they outvoted me." As Roy Porter shows in <em>Madness: A Brief History</em>, thinking about who qualifies as insane, what causes mental illness, and how such illness should be treated has varied wildly throughout recorded history, sometimes veering dangerously close to the arbitrariness Lee describes and often encompassing cures considerably worse than the illness itself.<br> Drawing upon eyewitness accounts of doctors, writers, artists, and the mad themselves, Roy Porter tells the story of our changing notions of insanity and of the treatments for mental illness that have been employed from antiquity to the present day. Beginning with 5,000-year-old skulls with tiny holes bored in them (to allow demons to escape), through conceptions of madness as an acute phase in the trial of souls, as an imbalance of "the humors," as the "divine fury" of creative genius, or as the malfunctioning of brain chemistry, Porter shows the many ways madness has been perceived and misperceived in every historical period. He takes us on a fascinating round of treatments, ranging from exorcism and therapeutic terror--including immersion in a tub of eels--to the first asylums, shock therapy, the birth of psychoanalysis, and the current use of psychotropic drugs.<br> Throughout, <em>Madness: A Brief History</em> offers a balanced view, showing both the humane attempts to help the insane as well as the ridiculous and often cruel misunderstanding that have bedeviled our efforts to heal the mind of its myriad afflictions.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Roy Porter</strong> is Professor of the Social History of Medicine at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London. He is the author of over 80 books, including <em>Enlightenment: Britain and the Creation of the Modern World</em> and <em>A Social History of Madness</em>.<br><br>"A brief and fascinating history of insanity."--Susan Salter Reynolds, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"In just over 200 pages Porter manages to cram in everything from 7,000-year-old skulls with holes bored into them to release demons to the rise of psychopharmacology. In between we get Greco-Roman rationalism, the bloody and persistent belief that mental illness was caused by a compromised faith in God (approximately 200,000 witches killed), the rebirth of the humors (blood, choler, melancholy, and--my favorite--phlegm), institutionalization, Freudian analysis, de-institutionalization, the death of Freudian analysis (to your computers, Cambridge analysts!), and the glorification of insanity under Michel Foucault. It's a rich history, and because of Porter's delightful habit of bringing in colorful figures to fill out the story, his book seems bright even when walking the dingy halls of Bedlam."--<em>Sunday Boston Globe</em><p></p><br>"The sudden and unexpected death of Roy Porter in March robbed the English-speaking world of one of its most prolific, colorful and talented social historians.... <em>Madness</em>...displays several of his virtues: his wide reading, his prodigious memory, his extraordinary capacity for synthesis, his eye for an anecdote, and the sheer fun he took in telling a story."--<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"A magisterial synthesis of 1,000 years of mental illness and psychiatric remedies. The book wears its learning so lightly that in an afternoon's perusal, the average reader has a genuinely informed account of what all the shouting has been about."--<em>Toronto Globe and Mail</em><p></p><br>"This small book is rich in detail yet never loses sight of the broader ebb and flow in society's beliefs about what constitutes mental illness."--<em>Houston Chronicle</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Key to Algebra, Book 3: Equations (KEY TO...WORKBOOKS)</h2><p><p>In <em>Key to Algebra</em> new algebra concepts are explained in simple language, and examples are easy to follow.

We learn from Ramsay the interpreter of his present and his past. We learn about the intellectual predilections of the eighteenth-century historian: the values, assumptions, principles, and expectations of one who lived and wrote amidst the events he narrated. We learn from the ways in which he shaped history; his use of language, his sense of the significance of people and events, his narrative style, his use of history as propaganda, as exhortation, and as fiction. As Cohen explains quite clearly, we do not rely on Ramsay to tell us what happened during the Revolution. In most respects we know a great deal more about what happened than he did, particularly since we are now the arbiters of what is significant. We rely on Ramsay not for information, but for the ways in which he reveals the sensibility through which the events of his era were filtered.<br><br><i><b>SirReadaLot.org<br></b></i>June 2006</p><h2>Basic Elements of Landscape Architectural Design</h2><p>Singularly highlights landscape architectural elements with clear design principles!

Few books in the couple therapy market bridge the gap between theory and practice; texts tend to lean in one direction or the other, either emphasizing theory and research with little practical application, or taking a cookbook approach that describes specific techniques and interventions that are divorced from any conceptual or theoretical base. However, couples therapy requires a high degree of abstract/conceptual thinking, as well as ingenuity, inventiveness and skill on the part of the therapist. <em>Case Studies in Couples Therapy</em> blends the best of all worlds: clinical applications with challenging and diverse couples that have been derived from the most influential theories and models in couples and family therapy, all written by highly experienced and respected voices in the field. </p> <p>In <em>Case Studies in Couples Therapy,</em> readers will grasp the essentials of major theories and approaches in a few pages and then see how concepts and principles are applied in the work of well-known clinicians. The case studies incorporate a wide variety of couples from diverse backgrounds in a number of different life situations. It is simultaneously narrow (including specific processes and interventions applied with real clients) and broad (clearly outlining a broad array of theories and concepts) in scope, and the interventions in it are directly linked to theoretical perspectives in a clear and systematic way. Students and clinicians alike will find the theoretical overview sections of each chapter clear and easy to follow, and each chapter&#x2019;s thorough descriptions of effective, practical interventions will give readers a strong sense of the connections between theory and practice. <br></p></p><p><p>Dr. David K.

The risk is there because, as W. B. Yeats has put it, education is not about filling a bucket but about lighting a fire. It is there because students are not to be seen as objects to be moulded and disciplined, but as subjects of action and responsibility. The Beautiful Risk of Education is organised around a critical discussion of seven key educational concepts: creativity, communication, teaching, learning, emancipation, democracy, and virtuosity. By opposing the risk aversion that characterises many contemporary educational policies and practices, Gert J.J. Biesta makes a strong argument for giving risk a central place in our educational endeavours and brings risk taking to the forefront of a critical pedagogical practice.</p><p><b>Gert Biesta</b> (www.gertbiesta.com) is Professor of Educational Theory and Policy at the University of Luxembourg, former president of the Philosophy of Education Society USA, and editor-in-chief of the journal Studies in Philosophy and Education.

He also co-edited George Herbert Mead's <i>The Philosophy of Education</i> (2008)."Beautiful Risk of Education is rhetorically ingenious and ironically quite powerful. Biesta's intellectual project does not just bid us to think differently about education, but suggests a more aspiring motivation to educate." <br>&#x2015;Teachers College Record <br> <br>&#x201c;In his latest book, The Beautiful Risk of Education, Gert Biesta calls for a weak education. Instead of arguing for education to become stronger, more secure, more predictable, and risk-free, he returns to precisely those qualities of education that are bemoaned by current standardized testing and measurement trends as defects to be overcome. Indeed, Biesta makes the claim that the stronger education becomes, the more we lose sight of what education actually is: a practice that is slow, difficult, insecure, unpredictable, and full of risks and uncertainties...the clarity, exactitude, and formal rigor of his presentation embody a kind of philosophical beauty in its own right. The prose is nothing less than elegant.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Educational Theory <br> <br>&#x201c;This us a carefully crafted work that rewards an equally considered effort by the reader. Gert Biesta presents an elaborate, thoroughly referenced and researched critique of assumptions currently embedded in contemporary education.

Frequently from a single paragraph a range of avenues emerge, each worth pursuing in its own right.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Resurgence &amp; Ecologist<br>&#x201c;Penned by a brilliant scholar with a generous heart, Beautiful Risk solidifies Biesta&#x2019;s place as an international leader in philosophy of education.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Lynda Stone, University of North Carolina <br> <br>&#x201c;The Beautiful Risk of Education is a thought-provoking and riveting book by Gert Biesta, a book that gives education back to schools, colleges, universities, and adult or community education. Against the risk aversion of policy makers and politicians, in which education more or less evaporates from the practical settings, Biesta makes an argument for giving risk a central place in educational endeavors, hence preventing the subjects involved from turning into machine-like beings. The Beautiful Risk of Education will be read and re-read for decades to come as education is seen from new and unexpected angles.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;Dr. Herner Saeverot, University of Bergen</p><h2>Theory of Value: An Axiomatic Analysis of Economic Equilibrium (Cowles Foundation Monographs Series)</h2><p>The contribution of this short book consists in a rigorous, axiomatic, and formal analysis of producer behavior, consumer behavior, general equilibrium, and the optimality of the market mechanism for resource allocation.<br>"There can be no doubt that it is an important landmark of economic theory."&#x2015;F.H.

Although the twentieth century is often called &#34;the century of sex&#34; and seen as an era of increasing liberalization, Dagmar Herzog instead emphasizes the complexities and contradictions in sexual desires and behaviours, the ambivalences surrounding sexual freedom, and the difficulties encountered in securing sexual rights. Incorporating the most recent scholarship on a broad range of conceptual problems and national contexts, the book investigates the shifting fortunes of marriage and prostitution, contraception and abortion, queer and straight existence. It analyzes sexual violence in war and peace, the promotion of sexual satisfaction in fascist and democratic societies, the role of eugenics and disability, the politicization and commercialization of sex, and processes of secularization and religious renewal.</p><p>A compelling account of the tumultuous history of Europe&#39;s &#39;century of sex&#39;.

Thomas Otte reveals why a century-old system of Great Power politics collapsed so disastrously in the weeks from the &#39;shot heard around the world&#39; on June 28th to Germany&#39;s declaration of war on Russia on August 1st. He shows definitively that the key to understanding how and why Europe descended into world war is to be found in the near-collective failure of statecraft by the rulers of Europe and not in abstract concepts such as the &#39;balance of power&#39; or the &#39;alliance system&#39;. In this unprecedented panorama of Europe on the brink, from the ministerial palaces of Berlin and Vienna to Belgrade, London, Paris and St Petersburg, Thomas Otte reveals the hawks and doves whose decision-making led to a war that would define a century and which still reverberates today.</p><p>A definitive new account of the catalytic events that led to the outbreak of the First World War.

When it first appeared, Professor Dobb&#39;s detailed analysis of the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemical pursuits further stimulated interest in the subject by firmly establishing the importance of alchemy in Newton&#39;s thought. This book sets the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemy in their historical context in Restoration England. It is shown that alchemical modes of thought and particularly those of a Neoplatonic kind, were quite strong in many of those who provided the dynamism for the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century and that these modes of thought had important relationships with general movements for reform in the same period: reform of religion, philosophy, learning, society and of man himself. Newton&#39;s alchemy is thus seen as a critical link between Renaissance Hermeticism and the rational chemistry and mechanics of the eighteenth century.</p><p>This book sets the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemy in their historical context in Restoration England.

Intelligence can gain these advantages through directed research and analysis, agile collection, and the timely use of guile and theft.

Its purpose is the same as that of positive intelligence&#x2015;to gain advantage&#x2015;but it does so by exploiting, disrupting, denying, or manipulating the intelligence activities of others. The tools of counterintelligence include security systems, deception, and disguise: vaults, mirrors, and masks.<br><br>In one indispensable volume, top practitioners and scholars in the field explain the importance of counterintelligence today and explore the causes of&#x2015;and practical solutions for&#x2015;U.S. counterintelligence weaknesses.

He reveals how to approach dangerous conflicts?domestic violence, war, slavery, fascism, insanity, and oppression?to uncover hidden choices and transformational opportunities that help people and organizations develop, grow, and learn more about themselves. Offering a wealth of fresh possibilities, Mediating Dangerously identifies potential openings, creative techniques, and new and unusual approaches to dispute resolution. The book includes specific guidelines, questions to ask, sample dialogues, checklists, and diagrams to help readers apply new techniques immediately in their current practice. The inevitable stress and pain of conflict can lure mediation professionals into taking the easy route to a quick compromise. But, claims Cloke, the role of mediators is not simply to settle conflicts or fashion agreements, but to create choices. This means going further, taking risks, opening wounds, and exploring dangerous terrain to locate the center of what isn&#39;t working. It requires great courage, honesty, and self-knowledge to open a Pandora&#39;s box of fear, resistance, dishonesty, revenge, oppression, and all the defenses and rationalizations that keep individuals, organizations, and societies locked in conflict. Mediating Dangerously shows conflict resolution professionals how to advance beyond the traditional steps, procedures, and techniques of mediation to unveil its invisible heart and soul and to reveal the subtle and sensitive engine that drives the process of personal and organizational transformation. This book is a major new contribution to the literature of conflict resolution that will inspire and educate professionals in the field for years to come.

His conclusions are stark: the ice caps are melting. Following the hottest summer on record, sea ice in September 2016 was the thinnest in recorded history. There is now the probability that within a few years the North Pole will be ice-free for the first time in 10,000 years, entering what some call the "Artic death spiral." As sea ice, as well as land ice on Greenland and Antarctica, continues to melt, the rise in sea levels will devastate coastal communities across the world. The collapse of summer ice in the Artic will release large amounts of methane currently trapped by offshore permafrost. Methane has twenty-three times greater greenhouse warming effect per molecule than CO2; an ice-free arctic summer will therefore have an albedo effect nearly equivalent to that of the last thirty years. <br><br>A sobering but urgent and engaging book, <em>A Farewell to Ice </em>shows us ice's role on our planet, its history, and the true dimensions of the current global crisis, offering readers concrete advice about what they can do, and what must be done.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Wadhams</strong> is Professor of Ocean Physics and Head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University. He has completed over fifty research trips to the arctic.<br><br>"In a new book . . . this most experienced and rational scientist states what so many other researchers privately fear but cannot publicly say - that the Arctic is approaching a death spiral which may see the entire remaining summer ice cover collapse in the near future." - John Vidal, <em>The Guardian</em> <br><p></p><br>"Nonscientists who read his astonishing and hair-raising <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> will agree that the interludes of autobiography it contains are engrossing, entertaining and, when one submarine suffers an onboard explosion and fire while under the ice, harrowing. Any reader should find the science of sea-ice creation and the implications for us all of its loss - explored and explained here with clarity and style - beautiful, compelling and terrifying." - Horatio Clare, <em>The Observer</em><p></p><br>"Not only is <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> a clear and engaging account of how the physics and chemistry of ice work, but it also offers what may be the best chapter-length, reader-friendly account of the greenhouse effect available to date. . . . Wadhams's particular combination - of scientific passion, a lyrical sense of wonder at the natural world, an ability to pluck clear analogies from the air, and outspoken analysis of consumer-capitalist politics - marks out <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> as essential reading." - John Burnside, <em>New Statesman</em> <br><p></p><br>"Peter Wadhams brings huge expertise to his subject - and he is an excellent writer. He explains why the fate of Arctic ice is crucial for the world's climate and clarifies the controversies and complexities that confront scientists and policymakers. A fascinating book." - Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal, President of the Royal Society 2005-10<p></p><br>"Peter Wadhams has written a passionate, authoritative overview of the role of ice in our climate system, past, present and, scarily, the future." - Carl Wunsch, Professor Emeritus of Physical Oceanography, Massachusetts Institute of Technology<p></p><br>"Though the science behind global climate change can be made simple, its scientific complexities go a long way toward putting the impending catastrophe into context. <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> does an excellent job of laying out and explaining these complexities in all of their nuance... an excellent motivator and wake-up call..." --<em>Foreword Reviews</em><p></p><br>"For almost five decades, Peter Wadhams has been studying the way the ice at both poles has been changing. What he reveals in <em>A Farewell to Ice</em> is a chilling view of how much influence humankind has had on the steady disappearance of polar ice and what that will mean for all living things on the planet as it continues to vanish." --<em>Shelf Awareness</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Contracts: The Essential Business Desk Reference</h2><p><b></b><p><b>Life has become an endless series of contracts&#x2015;this is the manual.</b><br><br> There&#x2019;s no reason to risk your hard-earned money signing a contract you don&#x2019;t understand.

After being grouped into several basic approaches: cultural, dramaturgical, interaction ritual, symbolic interactionist, exchange, stuctural, and biological, the theories that have been developed within these diverse traditions are described. Summaries of Illustrative empirical work using the theory follow.</p><p>All social relations involve emotional responses, from the simplest face-to-face encounter through the mobilization of social movements to the commitments that individuals develop for culture and society. The social world is thus dependent upon the arousal of emotions, and equally significant conflict and change in societies is ultimately driven by emotional arousal. Thus, it is important to understand how human emotions influence, and are influenced by, the social world. This understanding takes us into the sociology of emotions that has emerged as a distinct area of inquiry over the last thirty years.Jonathan Turner is a general theorist who seeks to integrate existing theories into more robust and formal theories.

It eventually dragged most of Europe and the world into its bloody quagmire, inflicting more than four years of suffering, misery, maiming, and death on the belligerent nations. Ideal for undergraduate and graduate courses, <em>A History of the Great War: World War One and the International Crisis of the Early Twentieth Century</em> is a brief yet comprehensive study that distinguishes itself from other textbooks in significant ways. Providing broader coverage than most texts, it discusses the phenomenon of the war in its chronological entirety. Author Eric Dorn Brose analyzes the forces that generated international tension and made wars more prevalent before 1914; the causes and course of the Great War to 1918; and the violent and problematic aftermath of the struggle to 1926. Rather than focusing exclusively on military developments, Brose also examines the war's underlying causes, its political and diplomatic dimensions, and its myriad consequences.<br> Explicitly global in scope, <em>A History of the Great War</em> offers a more extensive look at the worldwide side of the Great War than existing texts do, including coverage of the campaigns spanning Northeast Africa, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Central Asia, India, and the war at sea. In addition, the author incorporates and discusses recent groundbreaking research in the "Notes" section of each chapter, so that students can easily access it. The text is also enhanced by maps, photos, and an engaging vignette at the opening of each chapter that serves as an introduction.<br></p><p>Eric Brose is Professor of History at Drexel University.<br>"Brose confirms his status as a master scholar of modern war in this comprehensive, well-crafted account of the defining event of the twentieth century. His analysis of its origins shows the Great War was neither accidental nor inevitable. His balancing of great events and individual experiences enlightens as well as informs. His perceptive judgment of consequences suggests that for all its horrors, the war was also a step towards peace and social justice in Europe."--Dennis Showalter, <em>Colorado College</em><p></p><br>"Brose builds effectively on recent global treatments of World War I. This welcome volume is also one of the few works of its kind to understand the war in relation to events that occurred before and after. As such, it places the war in a wide context and offers readers a deep understanding of this critical event in world history."--Michael S. Neiberg, <em>The University of Southern Mississippi</em><p></p><br>"Brose's engaging and detailed <em>A History of the Great War</em> captures the complexity of the era.

How did description come to seem separable from theory in the precursors of economics and the social sciences?<br> <br> Mary Poovey explores these questions in <i>A History of the Modern Fact</i>, ranging across an astonishing array of texts and ideas from the publication of the first British manual on double-entry bookkeeping in 1588 to the institutionalization of statistics in the 1830s. She shows how the production of systematic knowledge from descriptions of observed particulars influenced government, how numerical representation became the privileged vehicle for generating useful facts, and how belief&#x2014;whether figured as credit, credibility, or credulity&#x2014;remained essential to the production of knowledge.<br> <br> Illuminating the epistemological conditions that have made modern social and economic knowledge possible, <i>A History of the Modern Fact</i> provides important contributions to the history of political thought, economics, science, and philosophy, as well as to literary and cultural criticism.<br> <br></p></p><p><b>Mary Poovey</b> has recently retired from her position as Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities at New York University. She is the author of numerous books, including <i>A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society</i> and <i>Genres of the Credit Economy: Mediating Value in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain</i>.<br> &nbsp;Poovey (English, New York Univ.) defines the modern fact as systematic knowledge that is derived from the theoretical interpretation of observed particulars, i.e., numbers. This distinction between description (numbers) and interpretation has not always been made, and in this work Poovey is interested in how numbers came to be seen as value-free and impartial while the theories used to interpret them are widely understood to be influenced by social and political factors. From the development of double-entry bookkeeping in the late 16th century to the early use of statistics in the 1830s, Poovey focuses on the history of wealth and economics in Britain. During this period numerical representations became an increasingly important vehicle for producing knowledge and displaying mercantile credibility and virtue and ultimately economic and social prestige. The modern fact is a pioneering epistemological designation, and this book is an important contribution to the history of science and thought as well as literary and cultural criticism. Written mainly for the scholar, this book is recommended for large public libraries with research collections and academic libraries strong in the social sciences.?Jim Woodman, Boston Athenaeum<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Introducing Syntax (Cambridge Introductions to Language and Linguistics)</h2><p>Syntax is the system of rules that we subconsciously follow when we build sentences.

Whereas previous accounts have emphasised the growth of state-run armies during this period, David Parrott argues instead that the delegation of military responsibility to sophisticated and extensive networks of private enterprise reached unprecedented levels. This included not only the hiring of troops but their equipping, the supply of food and munitions, and the financing of their operations. The book reveals the extraordinary prevalence and capability of private networks of commanders, suppliers, merchants and financiers who managed the conduct of war on land and at sea, challenging the traditional assumption that reliance on mercenaries and the private sector results in corrupt and inefficient military force. In so doing, the book provides essential historical context to contemporary debates about the role of the private sector in warfare.</p><p>An important re-evaluation of early modern warfare and its relationship to the power of the state.

A strong conceptual understanding of these basic mechanics principles is essential for successfully solving mechanics problems. This edition of Vector Mechanics for Engineers will help instructors achieve these goals. Continuing in the spirit of its successful previous editions, this edition provides conceptually accurate and thorough coverage together with a significant refreshment of the exercise sets and online delivery of homework problems to your students. This edition has undergone a complete rewrite to modernize and streamline the language through the text. Over 650 of the homework problems in the text are new or revised. One of the characteristics of the approach used in this book is that mechanics of particles is clearly separated from the mechanics of rigid bodies. This approach makes it possible to consider simple practical applications at an early stage and to postpone the introduction of the more difficult concepts.</p><p>McGraw-Hill's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item.

In general, boys don't enjoy writing as much as girls. What's wrong? How can we do a better of job of creating &#x201c;boy-friendly&#x201d; classrooms so their voices can be heard?</p><p><em>In Boy Writers: Reclaiming Their Voices</em> Ralph Fletcher draws upon his years of experience as staff developer, children's book author, and father of four boys. He also taps the insights from dozens of writing teachers around the US and abroad. <em>Boy Writers</em> asks teachers to imagine the writing classroom from a boy's perspective, and consider specific steps we might take to create stimulating classrooms for boys.</p><p>Topic choice emerges as a crucial issue. The subjects many boys like to write about (war, weapons, outlandish fiction, zany or bathroom humor) often do not get a warm reception from teachers. Ralph argues that we must &#x201c;widen the circle&#x201d; and give boys more choice if we want to engage them as writers. How? We must begin by recognizing boys and the world in which they live. <em>Boy Writers</em> explores important questions such as:What subjects are boy writers passionate about, and what motivates them as writers?Why do boys like to incorporate violence into their stories, and how much should be allowed? Why do we so often misread and misunderstand the humor boys include in their stories?</p><p>In addition, the book looks at: how handwriting can hamstring boy writers, and how drawing may help; welcoming boy-friendly writing genres in our classrooms; ways to improve our conferring with boys; and more. </p><p>Each chapter begins with a thorough discussion of a topic and ends with a highly practical section titled: "What can I do in my classroom?" <em>Boy Writers</em> does not advocate promoting the interests of boys at the expense of girls. Rather, it argues that developing sensitivity to the unique facets of boy writers will help teachers better address the needs of all their students. </p></p><p>Ralph Fletcher has always been a special person for children&#39;s literature. He is the author of picture books, nonfiction, and novels for young readers. How to Write Your Life Story is the fifth book in Mr. Fletcher&#39;s series of instructional writing books, which includes A Writer&#39;s Notebook, Live Writing, How Writers Work, and Poetry Matters. Mr. Fletcher lives with his family in New Hampshire."Although classroom teachers should find Fletcher's advice especially thought-provoking and useful, <i>Boy Writers</i> is written for a broader audience, including parents, teacher educators, literacy advocates and perhaps even policy makers and boys themselves." - <i>Education Review</i><br><br><br>"A good read and well worth the time and money. <i>Boy Writers</i> would be good for teachers looking for a staff development study around gender-specific teaching strategies or writing improvement." - Teacher Learners Network<br><br><br>"Fletcher's book will surely keep me returning to his ideas time and time again. This book must be read by teachers (both male and female) in order to reach our boy writers." - RecycleYourReads.com<br></p><h2>The Communist Manifesto: With Related Documents (Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>A combination of the complete work and key foundational documents, Communist Manifesto explores the the evolution of and influences on Marxist theory over time, touching on how the content should be read now that the Cold War is over to help you connect to the material.</p><p>"A spectre is haunting Europe," Karl Marx and Frederic Engels wrote in 1848, "the spectre of Communism." This new edition of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i>, commemorating the 150th anniversary of its publication, includes an introduction by renowned historian Eric Hobsbawm which reminds us of the document's continued relevance. Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism and its deleterious effect on all aspects of life, from the increasing rift between the classes to the destruction of the nuclear family, has proven remarkably prescient. Their spectre, manifested in the <i>Manifesto</i>'s vivid prose, continues to haunt the capitalist world, lingering as a ghostly apparition even after the collapse of those governments which claimed to be enacting its principles."A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism." So begins one of history's most important documents, a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics, but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear, striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848, it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society "in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all." <br>The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy, which continues to inspire influential economic, political, social, and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document, one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. <br>This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces, and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions.</p><h2>Introductory Biomechanics: From Cells to Organisms (Cambridge Texts in Biomedical Engineering)</h2><p>Introductory Biomechanics is a new, integrated text written specifically for engineering students. It provides a broad overview of this important branch of the rapidly growing field of bioengineering. A wide selection of topics is presented, ranging from the mechanics of single cells to the dynamics of human movement. No prior biological knowledge is assumed and in each chapter, the relevant anatomy and physiology are first described. The biological system is then analyzed from a mechanical viewpoint by reducing it to its essential elements, using the laws of mechanics and then tying mechanical insights back to biological function. This integrated approach provides students with a deeper understanding of both the mechanics and the biology than from qualitative study alone. The text is supported by a wealth of illustrations, tables and examples, a large selection of suitable problems and hundreds of current references, making it an essential textbook for any biomechanics course. C. Ross Ethier is a professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, the Canada Research Chair in Computational Mechanics, and the Director of the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering at the University of Toronto, with cross-appointment to the Department of Ophthalmology &amp; Vision Sciences. His research focuses on biomechanical factors in glaucoma and blood flow and mass transfer in the large arteries. He has taught biomechanics for over ten years. Craig A. Simmons is the Canada Research Chair in Mechanobiology and an assistant professor of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto, with cross-appointments to the Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering and the Faculty of Dentistry. His research interests include cell and tissue biomechanics and cell mechanobiology, particularly as it relates to tissue engineering and heart valve disease.</p><p>This text introduces students to a wide selection of topics in biomechanics, ranging from the mechanics of single cells to the dynamics of human movement.

The first volume takes the story from 1900 to mid-century. The second brings the history up to date.</p><br><p> As Scott Soames tells it, the story of analytic philosophy is one of great but uneven progress, with leading thinkers making important advances toward solving the tradition's core problems. Though no broad philosophical position ever achieved lasting dominance, Soames argues that two methodological developments have, over time, remade the philosophical landscape. These are (1) analytic philosophers' hard-won success in understanding, and distinguishing the notions of logical truth, a priori truth, and necessary truth, and (2) gradual acceptance of the idea that philosophical speculation must be grounded in sound prephilosophical thought. Though Soames views this history in a positive light, he also illustrates the difficulties, false starts, and disappointments endured along the way. As he engages with the work of his predecessors and contemporaries--from Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein to Donald Davidson and Saul Kripke--he seeks to highlight their accomplishments while also pinpointing their shortcomings, especially where their perspectives were limited by an incomplete grasp of matters that have now become clear.</p><br><p> Soames himself has been at the center of some of the tradition's most important debates, and throughout writes with exceptional ease about its often complex ideas. His gift for clear exposition makes the history as accessible to advanced undergraduates as it will be important to scholars. Despite its centrality to philosophy in the English-speaking world, the analytic tradition in philosophy has had very few synthetic histories. This will be the benchmark against which all future accounts will be measured.</p></p><p><p>"A history of analytic philosophy and an excellent piece of analytic philosophy in its own right. We can all benefit from Soames's discussion of the central issues that have shaped the subject and his assessment of what we have achieved and where we might have gone wrong."<b>--Kit Fine, New York University</b></p><p>"This monumental study is a careful assessment of the successes and the failures of twentieth-century analytic philosophy. Soames displays unfailingly sound judgment throughout. The work is invaluable to those of us who have contributed to this period of very recent history of thought, and more importantly, to our students who will build upon the triumphs and will profit from the defeats of ourselves and our predecessors, carrying philosophy forward into the new millennium. The work is also a comprehensive reality check in the face of persistent accusations (coming not only from those who do not understand analytic philosophy, but also from those who remain stuck in its recent failures) that analytic philosophy is a disease or a futile exercise in wheel spinning. Analytic philosophy is, and has always been, a rational quest for knowledge and understanding. Its tools are clarification, argument, and tutored intuition. Soames provides perspective concerning the best of recent philosophical thought, articulating its most important developments, dead ends, and discoveries."<b>--Nathan Salmon, University of California, Santa Barbara</b></p><p>"<i>Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century</i> is a critical examination of key texts and trends in analytic philosophy by one of its leading contemporary practitioners. Soames has applied his formidable forensic talents to highlight the insights and expose the errors of the major figures from Moore to Kripke. These two volumes are an essential resource for any serious student of analytic philosophy."<b>--Alex Byrne, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"Together these two volumes constitute an outstanding contribution to the field. They present the views and arguments of the major philosophers of the period with unmatched clarity and subject them to deep and critical scrutiny. In my view there is no other work on the history of twentieth-century century analytic philosophy that matches it in its scope, depth, and elegance."<b>--Ali Kazmi, University of Calgary</b></p><p>"This is an extraordinarily impressive piece of work. It will be very valuable to capable, advanced undergraduates, and I expect it to be used widely in graduate courses and discussed frequently by scholars. It provides a substantive vision of how and where real progress has been made by philosophers in the analytic tradition, as well as how and why analytic philosophy sometimes took a step backward. Soames himself is doing cutting-edge work in core areas of analytic philosophy and is thus able to bring a level of philosophical sophistication to his treatment that few have available to them."<b>--John Hawthorne, Rutgers University</b></p><b>Scott Soames</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Southern California.

These topics are related insofar as possible to the specific setting in which the Gospel was written, since one cannot understand such theological concepts in the abstract. The book is an ideal introduction to the question of the origin of the Gospel of John as well as its theology.</p><p>Concentrating on its presentation of Jesus as the Christ, this analysis of one of the most important documents of the New Testament considers as well the topics of God, the scriptures, the Church and the spirit, in relationship to the specific setting in which the Gospel was written."[Smith's] latest study is fresh, thought-provoking and consistently to the point.

This is a calculus that is central to modern mathematical logic and important for mathematicians, philosophers, and scientists whose work impinges upon logic.<br>Professor Curry begins by asking a simple question: What is mathematical logic? If we can define logic as "the analysis and criticism of thought" (W. E. Johnson), then mathematical logic is, according to Curry, "a branch of mathematics which has much the same relation to the analysis and criticism of thought as geometry does to the science of space."<br>The first half of the book gives the basic principles and outlines of the field. After a general introduction to the subject, the author discusses formal methods including algorithms and epitheory. A brief treatment of the Markov treatment of algorithms is included here. The elementary facts about lattices and similar algebraic systems are then covered. In the second half of the book Curry investigates the possibility for a formulation that expresses the meaning to be attached to the logical connectives and to develop the properties that follow from the assumptions so motivated. The author covers positive connectives: implication, conjunction, and alternation. He then goes on to negation and quantification, and concludes with modal operations. Extensive use is made in these latter chapters of the work of Gentzen. Lists of exercises are included.<br>Haskell B.

You are the ringmaster for 30 diverse learners. How are you going to teach in order to reach them all? What are you going to do to maintain their interest and enthusiasm to learn? Many teachers have found the concepts of the Process Communication Model (PCM) very useful in reaching every student and in keeping them motivated. Others have never heard of PCM. This book is for all of you.</p><p>What is PCM, and how can it help teachers reach out to students who have different needs and personality types? PCM is a powerful communication tool developed by Dr. Taibi Kahler, a clinical psychologist in Little Rock, Arkansas. Briefly stated, PCM provides a way for teachers and others to communicate with and motivate people by shifting to their preferred frame of reference. To categorize these frames of reference, Dr. Kahler (1982) identified six different personality types based on individuals' perceptions of the world (i.e., how they take in and process information). He found that each person prefers to communicate in different ways depending on his or her personality type (Kahler, 2000). In order to communicate effectively, then, Kahler suggests that people learn to speak the "languages" that other people prefer. His research shows that doing so will significantly increase the likelihood that the content of their message is "heard" and acted on. Dr. Kahler compares this to a person traveling to a foreign country. If residents of the foreign country do not speak the language of the traveler, then the traveler must speak their language if he or she wants to be understood. Dr. Kahler has identified six different "languages" people speak and six different ways people are motivated based on their personality type. In addition, he found that individuals of each personality type have predictable patterns of distress when their needs are not met positively.</p><p>According to the PCM research, everyone is one of these six personality types (Kahler, 1974). None of these types is any better or worse than any other, and each type has its strengths and weaknesses. Frequently, these weaknesses are seen when people become distressed because they have not gotten their motivational needs met positively. When people are in distress, they are not capable of thinking clearly; they will mask their true feelings and will display predictable negative behaviors. Usually, this results in miscommunication. This book focuses on how teachers can make positive interventions or even prevent these behaviors from occurring.</p><p>THE SIX PERSONALITY TYPES</p><p>Dr. Kahler (1974) has identified these six personality types:</p><ul><li>Reactors</li><br><br><li>Workaholics</li><br><br><li>Persisters</li><br><br><li>Dreamers</li><br><br><li>Rebels</li><br><br><li>Promoters</li></ul><p>The characteristics and perceptions of each of the six types are shown in Table 1.1 (Kahler 1982, 1996). The percentage of each type represented in the North American population is shown in Figure 1.1 (Kahler, 1982, 1996).</p><p>Reactors are people of great compassion, sensitivity, and warmth. They perceive the world through their emotions. They feel first &#x2014; about people, places and things &#x2014; and want others to share their feelings. They have great interpersonal skills and care about others. They like people and want to be liked in return. In fact, they need to hear that people like them not for anything they have done but for who they are. They are very good at nurturing others. Compassion is their currency. As a result, many Reactors become elementary school teachers or special education teachers.</p><p>Workaholics are people who are responsible, logical, and organized. They perceive the world through their thoughts. They value facts and view the world by identifying and categorizing people and things. They want people to think with them. Because they are information oriented, they believe the problems of the world can be solved if they just get enough information. Workaholics like to discuss options and to hear that people appreciate their ability to think clearly, come up with good ideas, and do a good job. Logic is their currency. Many middle school and high school teachers are Workaholics.</p><p>Persisters are conscientious, dedicated, and observant. They perceive the world through their opinions; they take in information and very quickly form opinions about everyone and everything. Once they have formed an opinion, it is difficult to get them to change their beliefs. They are committed to loyalty, quality, values, standards, and their mission of helping others succeed. They may not care if anyone likes them as long as their dedication and commitment are respected and appreciated. They want everyone to achieve to his or her full potential, and, as a result, many Persisters become teachers. Values are their currency. Many middle school and high school teachers are Persisters.</p><p>Dreamers are reflective, imaginative, and calm. They conceptualize things in ways that are different from how people of other types conceptualize things. They want to be told what is expected of them and then prefer to be left alone to carry out instructions. They take in information by reflection. This means that although they probably understand the information presented, they will reflect on it and not act on it unless given specific, concise instructions. They value direction. If they are engaged in something, they tend to continue to do it until told to do something else. Imagination is their currency. A few Dreamers become teachers, but not very many.</p><p>Rebels are spontaneous, creative, playful, and fun. They like to have a good time. They perceive the world through reactions &#x2014; that is, their likes and dislikes. They are energetic and may be artistic or musical. In fact, music, art, physical education, computer classes, and extracurricular activities help Rebels get through the school day. They prize spontaneity and creativity. Humor is their currency. Some Rebels become teachers, but not very many.</p><p>Promoters are resourceful, charming, and adaptable. They perceive the world by experiencing situations and by making things happen. They prize adaptability and self-sufficiency and like a lot of excitement in their lives. Charm is their currency, and they thrive on quick rewards. They are very direct and are action oriented. They want to do things now and get right to the bottom line &#x2014; no working 30 years for a gold watch for them! (In the classroom, Promoters would not want to wait even a grading period for a grade or a week for a sticker or free time). They want their reward today, this week, or this month. As a result, almost none of them become teachers.</p><p>Excerpted from chapter 1 of <b>Here's How to Reach Me: Matching Instruction to Personality Types in Your Classroom,</b> by Judith Pauley, Ph.D., Dianne Bradley, Ph.D., &amp; Joseph Pauley.</p><p>Copyright � 2002 by Paul H Brookes Publishing Co.

The ethics of care is only a few decades old, yet it is by now a distinct moral theory or normative approach to the problems we face. It is relevant to global and political matters as well as to the personal relations that can most clearly exemplify care.<br><br>This book clarifies just what the ethics of care is: what its characteristics are, what it holds, and what it enables us to do. It discusses the feminist roots of this moral approach and why the ethics of care can be a morality with universal appeal. Held examines what we mean by "care," and what a caring person is like. Where other moral theories demand impartiality above all, the ethics of care understands the moral import of our ties to our families and groups. It evaluates such ties, focusing on caring relations rather than simply on the virtues of individuals. The book proposes how such values as justice, equality, and individual rights can "fit together" with such values as care, trust, mutual consideration, and solidarity.<br><br>In the second part of the book, Held examines the potential of the ethics of care for dealing with social issues. She shows how the ethics of care is more promising than Kantian moral theory and utilitarianism for advice on how expansive, or not, markets should be, and on when other values than market ones should prevail. She connects the ethics of care with the rising interest in civil society, and considers the limits appropriate for the language of rights. Finally, she shows the promise of the ethics of care for dealing with global problems and seeing anew the outlines of international civility.<br></p><p><br><strong>Virginia Held</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York Graduate School and author of <em>Rights and Goods: Justifying Social Action</em> and <em>Feminist Morality: Transforming Culture, Society, and Politics</em>.<br><br>"Virginia Held's theory of care is no less substantial than John Rawls' theory of justice. Her probing and engaging analysis of caring values, virtues, actions, and attitudes will become a classic in moral theory."--Rosemarie Tong, The University of North Carolina at Charlotte<p></p><br></p><h2>New Practical Chinese Reader, Vol. 2 (2nd Edition): Workbook (with MP3 CD or QR Scan) (English and Chinese Edition)</h2><p>New Practical Chinese Reader, Vol. 2 (2nd Edition): Workbook (with MP3 CD) (English and Chinese Edition)</p><p></p><h2>Key to Algebra, Book 4: Polynomials (KEY TO...WORKBOOKS)</h2><p><p>In <em>Key to Algebra</em> new algebra concepts are explained in simple language, and examples are easy to follow.

Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema</h2><p><i>L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema</i> is the first book dedicated to the films and filmmakers of the L.A. Rebellion, a group of African, Caribbean, and African American independent film and video artists that formed at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the 1970s and 1980s. The group&#x2014;including Charles Burnett, Julie Dash, Haile Gerima, Billy Woodberry, Jamaa Fanaka, and Zeinabu irene Davis&#x2014;shared a desire to create alternatives to the dominant modes of narrative, style, and practice in American cinema, works that reflected the full complexity of Black experiences. This landmark collection of essays and oral histories examines the creative output of the L.A. Rebellion, contextualizing the group's film practices and offering sustained analyses of the wide range of works, with particular attention to newly discovered films and lesser-known filmmakers.

He is best known for his Consolation of Philosophy, which he wrote in prison awaiting execution. His works also include a long series of logical translations, commentaries and monographs and some short but densely-argued theological treatises, all of which were enormously influential on medieval thought. But Boethius was more than a writer who passed on important ancient ideas to the Middle Ages. The essays here by leading specialists, which cover all the main aspects of his writing and its influence, show that he was a distinctive thinker, whose arguments repay careful analysis and who used his literary talents in conjunction with his philosophical abilities to present a complex view of the world.</p><p>Covers all the important aspects of Boethius, a late ancient Latin philosopher, who was very widely studied in the Middle Ages.

Mr Wilson starts by describing the techniques of conceptual analysis. He then gives examples of them in action by composing answers to specific questions and by criticism of quoted passages of argument. Chapter 3 sums up the importance of this kind of mental activity.

Henry Edwards</i></b><i> </i> is emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee in 1960, and recently retired after 40 years of classroom teaching (including calculus or differential equations almost every term) at the universities of Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Georgia, with a brief interlude at the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton) as an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. He has received numerous teaching awards, including the University of Georgia's <i>honoratus</i> medal in 1983 (for sustained excellence in honors teaching), its Josiah Meigs award in 1991 (the institution's highest award for teaching), and the 1997 statewide Georgia Regents award for research university faculty teaching excellence. His scholarly career has ranged from research and dissertation direction in topology to the history of mathematics to computing and technology in the teaching and applications of mathematics. In addition to being author or co-author of calculus, advanced calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations textbooks, he is well-known to calculus instructors as author of <i>The Historical Development of the Calculus</i> (Springer-Verlag, 1979). During the 1990s he served as a principal investigator on three NSF-supported projects: (1) A school mathematics project including Maple for beginning algebra students, (2) A Calculus-with-<i>Mathematica</i> program, and (3) A MATLAB-based computer lab project for numerical analysis and differential equations students. </p> <p> <b> <i>David E. Penney,</i></b><i> </i> University of Georgia, completed his Ph.D. at Tulane University in 1965 (under the direction of Prof. L. Bruce Treybig) while teaching at the University of New Orleans. Earlier he had worked in experimental biophysics at Tulane University and the Veteran's Administration Hospital in New Orleans under the direction of Robert Dixon McAfee, where Dr. McAfee's research team's primary focus was on the active transport of sodium ions by biological membranes. Penney's primary contribution here was the development of a mathematical model (using simultaneous ordinary differential equations) for the metabolic phenomena regulating such transport, with potential future applications in kidney physiology, management of hypertension, and treatment of congestive heart failure. He also designed and constructed servomechanisms for the accurate monitoring of ion transport, a phenomenon involving the measurement of potentials in microvolts at impedances of millions of megohms. Penney began teaching calculus at Tulane in 1957 and taught that course almost every term with enthusiasm and distinction until his retirement at the end of the last millennium. During his tenure at the University of Georgia he received numerous University-wide teaching awards as well as directing several doctoral dissertations and seven undergraduate research projects. He is the author of research papers in number theory and topology and is the author or co-author of textbooks on calculus, computer programming, differential equations, linear algebra, and liberal arts mathematics. </p><p> Contemporary calculus instructors and students face traditional challenges as well as new ones that result from changes in the role and practice of mathematics by scientists and engineers in the world at large. As a consequence, this sixth edition of our calculus textbook is its most extensive revision since the first edition appeared in 1982. </p> <p> Two chapters of the fifth edition have been combined in a single more tightly organized one. An entirely new chapter now appears in the table of contents, and most of the remaining chapters have been extensively rewritten. About 125 of the book's over 750 worked examples are new for this edition and the 1825 figures in the text include 225 new computer-generated graphics. About 600 of its over 7000 problems are new, and these are augmented by 320 new conceptual discussion questions that now precede the problem sets. Moreover, 1050 new true/false questions are included in the Study Guides on the new CD-ROM that accompanies this edition. In summary, almost 2000 of these 8400-plus problems and questions are new, and the text discussion and explanations have undergone corresponding alteration and improvement. </p> <p><b>PRINCIPAL NEW FEATURES</b></p> <p> The current revision of the text features </p> <ul> <li>More unified treatment of <b>transcendental functions</b> in Chapter 7, and</li> <li>A new Chapter 9 on <b>differential equations</b> and applications.</li> </ul> <p> The new chapter on differential equations now appears immediately after Chapter 8 on techniques of integration. It includes both direction fields and Eider's method together with the more elementary symbolic methods (which exploit techniques from Chapter 8) and interesting applications of both first- and second-order equations. Chapter 11 (Infinite Series) now ends with a new section on power series solutions of differential equations, thus bringing full circle a unifying focus of second-semester calculus on elementary differential equations. </p> <p><b>NEW LEARNING RESOURCES</b></p> <p> <b>Conceptual Discussion Questions:</b> The set of problems that concludes each section is now preceded by a brief <b>Concepts: Questions and Discussion</b> set consisting of several open-ended conceptual questions that can be used for either individual study or classroom discussion. </p> <p> <b>The Text CD-ROM:</b> The content of the new CD-ROM that accompanies this text is fully integrated with the textbook material, and is designed specifically for use hand-in-hand with study of the book itself. This CD-ROM features the following resources to support learning and teaching: </p> <ul> <li> <b>Interactive True/False Study Guides</b> that reinforce and encourage student reading of the text.

Each problem solution in the system is structured algorithmically so that students can work in a computer lab setting to submit homework assignments for automatic grading. (There is a small annual fee per participating student.) </p> <p> <b>New Solutions Manuals:</b> The entirely new 1810-page <b>Instructor's Solutions Manual</b> (available in three volumes) includes a detailed solution for every problem in the book. These solutions were written exclusively by the authors and have been checked independently by others. </p> <p> The entirely new 930-page <b>Student Solutions Manual</b> (available in two volumes) includes a detailed solution for every odd-numbered problem in the text. The answers (alone) to most of these odd-numbered problems are included in the answers section at the back of this book. </p> <p> <b>New Technology manuals:</b> Each of the following manuals is available shrink-wrapped with any version of the text for half the normal price of the manual (all of which are inexpensive): </p> <ul> <li>Jensen, <i>Using MATLAB in Calculus</i> (0-13-027268-X)</li> <li>Freese/Stegenga, <i>Calculus Concepts Using Derive</i> (0-13-085152-3)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>TI Graphing Calculator Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092017-7)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>A Mathematica Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092015-0)</li> <li>Gresser, <i>A Maple Approach, 2e</i> (0-13-092014-2)</li> </ul> <p><b>THE TEXT IN MORE DETAIL...</b></p> <p> In preparing this edition, we have taken advantage of many valuable comments and suggestions from users of the first five editions. This revision was so pervasive that the individual changes are too numerous to be detailed in a preface, but the following paragraphs summarize those that may be of widest interest. </p> <p> � <b>New Problems</b>&#x2014;Most of the 600 new problems lie in the intermediate range of difficulty, neither highly theoretical nor computationally routine. Many of them have a new technology flavor, suggesting (if not requiring) the use of technology ranging from a graphing calculator to a computer algebra system. </p> <p> � <b>Discussion Questions and Study Guides</b>&#x2014;We hope the 320 conceptual discussion questions and 1050 true/false study-guide questions constitute a useful addition to the traditional fare of student exercises and problems. The True/False Study Guide for each section provides a focus on the key ideas of the section, with the single goal of motivating guided student reading of the section. </p> <p> � <b>Examples and Explanations</b>&#x2014;About one-sixth of the book's worked examples are either new or significantly revised, together with a similar percentage of the text discussion and explanations. Additional computational detail has been inserted in worked examples where students have experienced difficulty, together with additional sentences and paragraphs in similar spots in text discussions. </p> <p> � <b>Project Material</b>&#x2014;Many of the text's 33 projects are new for this edition. These appear following the problem sets at the ends of key sections throughout the text. Most (but not all) of these projects employ some aspect of modern computational technology to illustrate the principal ideas of the preceding section, and many contain additional problems intended for solution with the use of a graphing calculator or computer algebra system. Where appropriate, project discussions are significantly expanded in the CD-ROM versions of the projects. </p> <p> Historical Material&#x2014;Historical and biographical chapter openings offer students a sense of the development of our subject by real human beings. Indeed, our exposition of calculus frequently reflects the historical development of the subject&#x2014;from ancient times to the ages of Newton and Leibniz and Euler to our own era of new computational power and technology. </p> <p><b>TEXT ORGANIZATION</b></p> <p> � <b>Introductory Chapters</b>&#x2014;Instead of a routine review of precalculus topics, Chapter 1 concentrates specifically on functions and graphs for use in mathematical modeling. It includes a section cataloging informally the elementary transcendental functions of calculus, as background to their more formal treatment using calculus itself. Chapter 1 concludes with a section addressing the question "What is calculus?" Chapter 2 on limits begins with a section on tangent lines to motivate the official introduction of limits in Section 2.2. Trigonometric limits are treated throughout Chapter 2 in order to encourage a richer and more visual introduction to the limit concept. </p> <p> � <b>Differentiation Chapters</b>&#x2014;The sequence of topics in Chapters 3 and 4 differs a bit from the most traditional order. We attempt to build student confidence by introducing topics more nearly in order of increasing difficulty. The chain rule appears quite early (in Section 3.3) and we cover the basic techniques for differentiating algebraic functions before discussing maxima and minima in Sections 3.5 and 3.6 (in order to illustrate early some significant applications of the derivative). Section 3.7 treats the derivatives of all six trigonometric functions. The authors' fondness for Newton's method (Section 3.8) will be apparent. </p> <p> The mean value theorem and its applications are deferred to Chapter 4 (following implicit differentiation and related rates in Section 4.1, and differentials and linear approximation in Section 4.2). In addition, a dominant theme of Chapter 4 is the use of calculus both to construct graphs of functions and to explain and interpret graphs that have been constructed by a calculator or computer. This theme is developed in Sections 4.4 on the first derivative test and 4.6 on higher derivatives and concavity. </p> <p> � <b>Integration Chapters</b>&#x2014;Chapter 5 begins with a section on antiderivatives&#x2014;which could logically be included in the preceding chapter, but benefits from the use of integral notation. When the definite integral is introduced in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, we emphasize endpoint and midpoint sums rather than upper and lower and more general Riemann sums. This concrete emphasis carries through the chapter to its final section on numerical integration. Chapter 6 begins with a largely new section on Riemann sum approximations, with new examples centering on fluid flow and medical applications. Section 6.6 is a new treatment of centroids of plane regions and curves. </p> <p> Chapter 8 (Techniques of Integration) is organized to accommodate those instructors who feel that methods of formal integration now require less emphasis, in view of modern techniques for both numerical and symbolic integration. Integration by parts (Section 8.3) precedes trigonometric integrals (Section 8.4). The method of partial fractions appears in Section 8.5, and trigonometric substitutions and integrals involving quadratic polynomials follow in Sections 8.6 and 8.7. Improper integrals appear in Section 8.8, with new and substantial subsections on special functions and probability and random sampling. This rearrangement of Chapter 8 makes it more convenient to stop wherever the instructor desires. </p> <p> � <b>Calculus of Transcendental Functions</b>&#x2014;Section 7.1 (much strengthened for this edition) introduces the exponential and logarithmic functions from a fairly intuitive viewpoint; the approach based on the natural logarithm as an integral appears in Section 7.4. Sections 7.2 and 7.3 introduce 1'Hopital's rule and apply it to round out the calculus of exponential and logarithmic functions. Sections 7.5 and 7.6 cover both derivatives of and integrals involving inverse trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions. </p> <p> � <b>Differential Equations</b>&#x2014;This entirely new chapter begins with the most elementary differential equations and applications (Section 9.1) and then proceeds to introduce both graphical (slope field) and numerical (Eider) methods in Section 9.2. Subsequent sections of the chapter treat separable and linear first-order differential equations and (in more depth than usual in a calculus course) applications such as population growth (including logistic and predator-prey populations) and motion with resistance. The final two sections of Chapter 9 treat second-order linear equations and applications to mechanical vibrations. Instructors desiring still more coverage of differential equations can arrange with the publisher to bundle and use appropriate sections of Edwards and Penney, <b>Differential Equations: Computing and Modeling 2/e</b> (Prentice-Hall, 2000). </p> <p> � <b>Parametric Curves and Polar Coordinates</b>&#x2014;The principal change in Chapter 10 is the replacement of three separate sections in the 5th edition on parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas with a single Section 10.6 that provides a unified treatment of all the conic sections. </p> <p> � <b>Infinite Series</b>&#x2014;After the usual introduction to convergence of infinite sequences and series in Sections 11.2 and 11.3, a combined treatment of Taylor polynomials and Taylor series appears in Section 11.4. This makes it possible for the instructor to experiment with a briefer treatment of infinite series, but still offer exposure to the Taylor series that are so important for applications. The principal change in Chapter 11 is the addition of a new final section on power series methods and their use to introduce new transcendental functions, thereby concluding the middle third of the book with a return to differential equations. </p> <p> � <b>Multivariable Calculus</b>&#x2014;The treatment of calculus of more than a single variable is rather traditional, beginning with vectors, curves, and surfaces in Chapter 12. Chapter 13 features a strong treatment of multivariable maximum-minimum problems in Sections 13.5 (initial approach to these problems), 13.9 (Lagrange multipliers), and 13.10 (critical points of functions of two variables). Chapters 13 (Partial Differentiation), 14 (Multiple Integrals), and 15 (Vector Calculus) have been significantly rewritten for this edition. </p> <p><b>OPTIONS IN TEACHING CALCULUS</b></p> <p> <b>The Calculus Sequence</b>&#x2014;The present version of the text is accompanied by a less traditional version that treats transcendental functions earlier in single-variable calculus and includes matrices for use in multivariable calculus.

In this fascinating account of an American institution, Catherine A. Lutz and Jane L. Collins explore the possibility that the magazine, in purporting to teach us about distant cultures, actually tells us much more about our own.<br> <br> Lutz and Collins take us inside the National Geographic Society to investigate how its photographers, editors, and designers select images and text to produce representations of Third World cultures. Through interviews with the editors, they describe the process as one of negotiating standards of "balance" and "objectivity," informational content and visual beauty. Then, in a close reading of some six hundred photographs, they examine issues of race, gender, privilege, progress, and modernity through an analysis of the way such things as color, pose, framing, and vantage point are used in representations of non-Western peoples. Finally, through extensive interviews with readers, the authors assess how the cultural narratives of the magazine are received and interpreted, and identify a tension between the desire to know about other peoples and their ways and the wish to validate middle-class American values.<br> <br> The result is a complex portrait of an institution and its role in promoting a kind of conservative humanism that acknowledges universal values and celebrates diversity while it allows readers to relegate non-Western peoples to an earlier stage of progress. We see the magazine and the Society as a key middlebrow arbiter of taste, wealth, and power in America, and we get a telling glimpse into middle-class American culture and all the wishes, assumptions, and fears it brings to bear on our armchair explorations of the world.<br></p></p><p><b>Jane L.

Greater flows of immigration have the potential to substantially increase world income and reduce extreme poverty. Existing evidence indicates that immigration slightly enhances the wealth of natives born in destination countries while doing little to harm the job prospects or reduce the wages of most of the native-born population. Similarly, although a matter of debate, most credible scholarly estimates of the net fiscal impact of current migration find only small positive or negative impacts. Importantly, current generations of immigrants do not appear to be assimilating more slowly than prior waves. <br><br>Although the range of debate on the consequences of immigration is much narrower in scholarly circles than in the general public, that does not mean that all social scientists agree on what a desirable immigration policy embodies. The second half of this book contains three chapters, each by a social scientist who is knowledgeable of the scholarship summarized in the first half of the book, which argue for very different policy immigration policies. One proposes to significantly cut current levels of immigration. Another suggests an auction market for immigration permits. The third proposes open borders. The final chapter surveys the policy opinions of other immigration experts and explores the factors that lead reasonable social scientists to disagree on matters of immigration policy.<br></p><p><br>Benjamin Powell is the Director of the Free Market Institute and Professor of Economics in the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University.

Previous studies have tried to explain the attraction of the arena by theorizing about its cultural function in Roman society. The games have been seen as celebrations of the violence of empire or of Rome&#39;s martial heritage, or as manifestations of the emperor&#39;s power. The desire to watch has therefore been limited to the Roman context and rendered alien to modern sensibilities. Yet the historical record reveals that people living in quite different times and circumstances (including our own) have regularly come out in large numbers to watch public rituals of violence such as executions, floggings, animal-baiting, cudgeling, pugilism and so on. Appreciating the social-psychological dynamics at work in attracting people to watch such events not only deepens our understanding of the spectator at the Roman games but also suggests something important about ourselves.</p><p>Why did the spectacles of violence and bloodshed in the amphitheatre prove so appealing to the Romans? To answer this, Professor Fagan examines the ancient evidence in detail and draws on insights from modern studies of social psychology, and especially the behaviour of crowds.Garrett G. Fagan is Associate Professor of Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies and History at Pennsylvania State University, where he teaches courses in Roman and Greek history, Latin, and ancient warfare.

Studies of synaptic organization are bringing about a quiet revolution in achieving this goal, as documented by this unique book over the past 30 years. In this fifth edition, the results of the mouse and human genome projects are incorporated for the first time. Molecular biologists interested in functional genomics and proteomics of the brain will find answers here to the critical questions: what are the cell and circuit functions of gene products? Also for the first time, the reader is oriented to supporting neuroscience databases. Among the new advances covered are 2-photon confocal laser microscopy of dendrites and dendritic spines, biochemical analyses, and dual patch and multielectrode recordings, applied together with an increasing range of behavioral and gene-targeting methods. Leading experts in the best understood brain regions bring together the molecular, anatomical, functional, and behavioral data in authoritative integrated accounts. The chapters are organized in the same format, covering the neural elements, synaptic connections, basic circuits, physiology, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, membrane properties, dendritic properties, and with a final section on how the circuits mediate specific behaviors. The uniform framework for each chapter enables the authors to higlight the principles that are common to all regions, as well as the adaptations unique to each, thus serving as a model for understanding the neural basis of behavior.<br></p><p>Gordon M.

Bernstein argues that many of the most important themes in philosophy during the past one hundred and fifty years are variations and developments of ideas that were prominent in the classical American pragmatists: Charles S. Peirce, William James, John Dewey and George H Mead. Pragmatism begins with a thoroughgoing critique of the Cartesianism that dominated so much of modern philosophy. The pragmatic thinkers reject a sharp dichotomy between subject and object, mind-body dualism, the quest for certainty and the spectator theory of knowledge. They seek to bring about a sea change in philosophy that highlights the social character of human experience and normative social practices, the self-correcting nature of all inquiry, and the continuity of theory and practice. And they-especially James, Dewey, and Mead-emphasize the democratic ethical-political consequences of a pragmatic orientation. <p>Many of the themes developed by the pragmatic thinkers were also central to the work of major twentieth century philosophers like Wittgenstein and Heidegger, but the so-called analytic-continental split obscures this underlying continuity. Bernstein develops an alternative reading of contemporary philosophy that brings out the persistence and continuity of pragmatic themes. He critically examines the work of leading contemporary philosophers who have been deeply influenced by pragmatism, including Hilary Putnam, J�rgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, and Robert Brandom, and he explains why the discussion of pragmatism is so alive, varied and widespread. This lucid, wide-ranging book by one of America's leading philosophers will be compulsory reading for anyone who wants to understand the state of philosophy today.</p></p><p><p>One of the leading American philosophers writing and teaching today, <b>Richard J. Bernstein</b> is Vera List Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York and former dean of its graduate faculty. Prior to that, for more than two decades he was?professor of philosophy at Haverford College. Few contemporary philosophers are as influential in so many different intellectual disciplines and discussions as Bernstein. He is at home not only among American pragmatic philosophers with whom he is so closely identified but equally with Continental thinkers.</p>"Whoever wants to understand how the classical pragmatism of Dewey, James and Peirce could survive a long period of harsh criticism by analytical philosophy and come to vitality again at the end of the 20th century, should read this book. It is by far the most perceptive account of the persistence of pragmatist motives and themes in contemporary philosophy. Bernstein succeeds with eloquence, perspicacity and lucidity to show us why an idea as old as one hundred years is of highest importance for our philosophical self-understanding today."<br> <b>Axel Honneth, University of Frankfurt</b><br> <br> <p>"Richard Bernstein has written what is by far the best and most sophisticated account of recent and present-day pragmatist thought, including Rorty's and Brandom's. It is written with Bernstein's characteristic clarity, and it is the fruit of immense scholarship and deep thinking. It is a book that every serious student of these thinkers needs to read and think about."<br> <b>Hilary Putnam, Harvard University</b></p></p><h2>Beyond Critique: Exploring Critical Social Theories and Education</h2><p>This book introduces educational practitioners, students, and scholars to the people, concepts, questions, and concerns that make up the field of critical social theory. It guides readers into a lively conversation about how education can and does contribute to reinforcing or challenging relations of domination in the modern era.

What's unhealthy? What's safe? What's dangerous? Watch the news, and it's easy to be overwhelmed by snippets of badly presented science: information that's incomplete, confusing, contradictory, out-of-context, wrong, or flat-out dishonest. In this book, Dr. Sherry Seethaler provides a "bag of tricks" for making sense of science in the news. You'll learn how to think more sensibly about everything from mad cow disease to global warming and make better science-related decisions in both your personal life and as a citizen. You'll begin by understanding how science really works and progresses, and why scientists sometimes disagree. Seethaler helps you assess the possible biases of those who make scientific claims in the media, and place scientific issues in appropriate context, so you can intelligently assess tradeoffs. You'll learn how to determine whether a new study is really meaningful; uncover the difference between cause and mere coincidence; figure out which statistics mean something, and which don't. Finally, drawing on her extensive experience as a science journalist, she reveals the tricks self-interested players use to mislead and confuse you, and points you to sources of information you can actually rely upon.

Focusing particularly on genocide, but also on other forms of mass killing, torture, and war, Ervin Staub explores the psychological, cultural, and societal roots of group aggression. He sketches a conceptual framework for the many influences on one group&#39;s desire to harm another: cultural and social patterns predisposing to violence, historical circumstances resulting in persistent life problems, and needs and modes of adaptation arising from the interaction of these influences. Such notions as cultural stereotyping and devaluation, societal self-concept, moral exclusion, the need for connection, authority orientation, personal and group goals, &#34;better world&#34; ideologies, justification, and moral equilibrium find a place in his analysis, and he addresses the relevant evidence from the behavioral sciences. Within this conceptual framework, Staub then considers the behavior of perpetrators and bystanders in four historical situations: the Holocaust (his primary example), the genocide of Armenians in Turkey, the &#34;autogenocide&#34; in Cambodia, and the &#34;disappearances&#34; in Argentina. Throughout, he is concerned with the roots of caring and the psychology of heroic helpers. In his concluding chapters, he reflects on the socialization of children at home and in schools, and on the societal practices and processes that facilitate the development of caring persons, and of care and cooperation among groups. A wide audience will find The Roots of Evil thought-provoking reading.</p><p>How can human beings kill or brutalize multitudes of other human beings?

Exploring problems that had been left unsolved by traditional thought on democracy, Dahl here examines two influential models&#x2014;the Madisonian, which represents prevailing American doctrine, and its recurring challenger, populist theory&#x2014;arguing that they do not accurately portray how modern democracies operate. He then constructs a model more consistent with how contemporary democracies actually function, and, in doing so, develops some original views of popular sovereignty and the American constitutional system. <br> <br> For this fiftieth-anniversary edition, Dahl has written an extensive new afterword that reevaluates Madisonian theory in light of recent research.

"Data glut" obscures basic questions of justice and purpose and may even hinder rather than enhance our productivity.<br><br> In this revised and updated edition of <i>The Cult of Information</i>, Roszak reviews the disruptive role the computer has come to play in international finance and the way in which "edutainment" software and computer games degrade the literacy of children. At the same time, he finds hopeful new ways in which the library and free citizens' access to the Internet and the national data-highway can turn computer technology into a democratic and liberating force. Roszak's examination of the place of computer technology in our culture is essential reading for all those who use computers, who are intimidated by computers, or who are concerned with the appropriate role of computers in the education of our children.</p><p>The title notwithstanding, Theodore Roszak is no computer hater. But in an age that idolizes intelligent machines, he stands out as a rare cautionary voice. His book makes an eloquent case for a simple thesis: digital computing, far from being a panacea, has created as many problems as it solves. For Roszak, a fair measure of the fault lies with corporate hucksterism, a credulous educational establishment, and government's desire to control information. But the deeper worry is our own utopian techno-idealism--the belief that a scientific broom can sweep away our messy problems. The author challenges such computer messianism with a detailed, common-sense look at the history of what computing has actually brought us. The trends he sees--the conflation of data with knowledge, the erosion of human-centered values, and the rise of a digital oligarchy at just about everyone else's expense--are tough to deny. If you love computers, <i>The Cult of Information</i> is a provocative read, but one you shouldn't dodge."It is obvious that we can no longer proceed developing technologies with our eyes closed to its effects on our psychic habits, social relations and even political ideas.

It shows readers how to become <i>strategic thinkers</i>, thereby enhancing efficiency in decision-making about accessing and processing information. <b> </b> The goal of this book is to help you understand how you can <i>think better</i>, and the topics covered will help you reach that goal. It covers the eight skills necessary to become a strategic thinker: analysis, evaluation, induction, deduction, grouping, synthesis, abstracting, and persuasive expression. <b> </b> A book for anyone who wants to learn to better organize their thoughts and develop more efficient problem-solving techniques. </p></p><p><p> In a thought-provoking manner, Potter&#x2014;an expert on media literacy&#x2014;lays out eight essential skills that will empower students to become insightful, independent learners. Through these eight skills, the book takes the concept of critical thinking beyond the traditional focus on one or two skills, yielding a positive, more constructive approach. </p> <b>Features include:</b> <ul> <li>Learning objectives</li> <li>Running glossary in the margins</li> <li>Knowledge Styles Diagnostic Inventory</li> </ul> <p> Written in a personal, engaging style, <i>Becoming a Strategic Thinker</i> guides readers through the hurdles of filtering information to get the most value from it, generating useful and accurate knowledge structures, and communicating that knowledge to others in a powerfully persuasive way. </p><p> Have any of the following things ever happened to you? </p> <ul> <li>You are in a course and nothing seems to make sense to you. You just can't seem to get started learning the material.</li> <li>You spend many hours reading an assigned book or article, yet when you finish it you can't remember much of anything important that you just read.</li> <li>You study much more than other students, yet you earn lower grades than they do.</li> <li>When you hand in an exam, you are confident that you knew all the material that was tested, and you are convinced you have earned a good grade. But when you get the graded exam back, you see that points are marked off, and you did not do nearly as well as you expected.</li> <li>When your professor goes over the answers you wrote on a test, you are frustrated because you feel you knew the material but were not able to express it well in your answers.</li> </ul> <p> We all have experienced these things from time to time. Education is a continuing challenge, and at times students may get frustrated that they are not learning much, especially when they are working hard. If these experiences happen more than you would like them to, then you need to take some steps so that they won't continue to occur in the future. The best way to position yourself so that you will encounter more rewarding experiences instead of frustrating ones is to become a <i>strategic thinker.</i> </p> <p> Strategic thinkers are people who are able to make good decisions quickly about which information is most important and which can be ignored. They are able to catalog information in their mind effectively so they can retrieve it when they need it. Strategic thinkers are able to see the big picture&#x2014;about the world, their place in it, and how education will improve their place. With all this as context, they know how to transform information into knowledge effectively and efficiently. </p> <p> This book is not going to teach you how to think. You already know how to do that. You have made many good decisions and accomplished much already. You have significant abilities or you would not be in college. But you can always get better&#x2014;if you did not believe that you could strengthen your abilities even more, then you would not have made the sacrifice to enroll in college. </p> <p> My goal with this book is to help you understand how <i>you can</i> <b> <i>think better</i></b><i> </i> <i>by becoming a strategic thinker.</i> You will strengthen your ability to reason more <i>effectively</i> for yourself and depend less on the media and other people telling you what to think. You will learn to think more <i>efficiently</i> so that you can get greater rewards for the same amount of effort you have been putting into your courses. By becoming a strategic thinker, you will be able to solve problems in course assignments as well as in life more quickly and with more confidence. </p> <p><b>HOW TO BECOME A STRATEGIC THINKER</b></p> <p> In order to become a strategic thinker, you need two things. First, you need some <i>guidance;</i> second, you need <i>commitment</i> to working on exercises that will strengthen your skills and build up your knowledge structures. This book will help you with both of these tasks. </p> <p> In the chapters ahead, you will develop a set of eight skills that are the core tools for strategic thinking. In Chapter 1, you will see how strategic thinking is a powerful way to meet the challenges presented by the flood of information in our culture and in higher education. In Chapter 2, you will see that there is a core set of eight skills that strategic thinkers use as their primary tools when they encounter information and try to make sense of it. You will also learn how these skills are used to build knowledge structures. In Chapter 3, you will find out what your current knowledge style is and learn how to work from your basic knowledge style to become more of a strategic thinker. </p> <p> The next eight chapters present each of the eight skills of strategic thinking. They will help you develop each strategic thinking skill more fully and give you exercises so you can practice what you are learning. </p> <p> The book ends with a chapter that presents a springboard for developing the eight skills. You will see how to begin with your natural knowledge style, then work from your strengths to overcome your weaknesses in order to develop a more useful knowledge style. </p> <p> This book can open doors of understanding for you. But you must do your part. You need to consider carefully the ideas in each chapter, then incorporate those ideas into your own approach to information. Also, you will need to do the exercises presented in the eight skill chapters. Skills are like muscles&#x2014;they need to be exercised in order to get stronger. No matter how strong your skills are, you can make them even stronger. The more you work with them, the stronger they get. But if you give up working with them, they will get weaker. Exercising is the only way to improve them. </p> <p> Developing the eight skills requires an investment of effort from you. In the beginning, it may be difficult to get into the habit of doing the exercises. But when you commit to investing your time and effort to strengthen your skills, you will start down a road toward rewards that will more than pay back all your effort. Improvement may be slow at first, but if you keep investing your effort, the improvements will come faster. Once you start noticing the improvements, the exercises will seem easier, and the rewards will accelerate. </p> <p> The rewards from your investment of time and energy in developing as a strategic thinker will continue beyond this course. Because the strategic-thinking core skills apply to all bodies of knowledge, these skills can help you work with information and solve problems in any type of course. And even more important, you can use the skills outside of your college courses, in your everyday life&#x2014;to solve problems about friends and make better decisions about how to spend your time and money. Also, the more you develop this set of eight skills, the more successful you can be in any career beyond college. With stronger strategic-thinking skills, you will be more competitive for jobs in the most interesting and satisfying careers. Without these skills, however, you are limiting yourself to low-level jobs. For example, in the retail sales career path, if your skill set is limited to memorization, you can hold only a clerk-type position. Once hired, you will be given a list of procedures to memorize, such as how to run the cash register, how to stock the shelves, and how to put prices on the merchandise. You will do these things over and over. If instead you have a strong set of strategic-thinking skills, you can take on much more challenging&#x2014;and interesting&#x2014;tasks that may be different every day. You might be asked to determine what the prices of merchandise should be and when to put certain items on sale, to suggest changes in the layout of the store, and to train new employees. You need to demonstrate a greater skill set before you will be given these types of responsibilities. </p> <p> Think about what kind of a career you want to have, and ask yourself if you are developing the kind of skills that would prepare you for the "clerk" level or the "professional" level in that career. If you are interested in a career in medicine, would you prefer to dispense pills and treatments that others have prescribed, or would you rather diagnose people's problems and develop treatments? If you are interested in a career in law, would you prefer to check facts and type up other people's arguments, or would you rather construct your own arguments? If a professional career is what you want, then you need to develop a strong set of skills that help you filter out useless or bad information, filter in good information, and transform that good information into knowledge that can solve challenging problems. Once you have developed this set of skills, you are better able to think like a professional, regardless of the field&#x2014;medicine, law, business, architecture, teaching, engineering, writing, science, and so on. </p> <p> The ability to think strategically delivers many kinds of rewards, both in college courses and in the world outside academia. The earlier you develop this ability, the sooner you can start experiencing the many rewards. </p></p><h2>Student Solutions Manual for Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach Vol. 2(Chs 20-42)</h2><p>These popular and proven Solutions Manual help students build confidence before attempting end-of-chapter problems.

While we now know a great deal about the experience of victims of the Great Terror, we know almost nothing about the lower- and middle-level Narodnyi Komissariat Vnutrennikh Del (NKVD), or secret police, cadres who carried out Stalin's murderous policies. Unlike the postwar, public trials of Nazi war criminals, NKVD operatives were tried secretly. And what exactly happened in those courtrooms was unknown until now.<br><br>In what has been dubbed "the purge of the purgers," almost one thousand NKVD officers were prosecuted by Soviet military courts. Scapegoated for violating Soviet law, they were charged with multiple counts of fabrication of evidence, falsification of interrogation protocols, use of torture to secure "confessions," and murder during pre-trial detention of "suspects" - and many were sentenced to execution themselves. The documentation generated by these trials, including verbatim interrogation records and written confessions signed by perpetrators; testimony by victims, witnesses, and experts; and transcripts of court sessions, provides a glimpse behind the curtains of the terror. It depicts how the terror was implemented, what happened, and who was responsible, demonstrating that orders from above worked in conjunction with a series of situational factors to shape the contours of state violence.<br><br>Based on chilling and revelatory new archival documents from the Ukrainian secret police archives, <em>Stalinist Perpetrators on Trial</em> illuminates the darkest recesses of Soviet repression -- the interrogation room, the prison cell, and the place of execution -- and sheds new light on those who carried out the Great Terror.<br></p><p><br><strong>Lynne Viola</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Toronto.

Lynne Viola has written a fascinating and valuable work. The voices of those hangmen who ultimately became victims of the terror, as well as those they arrested, provide a stark picture of the Great Terror. The author explores the banality of evil in the Stalinist context: from the daily routine of torture and murder emerges the familiar figure of the self-righteous criminal."--Oleg V.

A 'must read' for scholars and students of the Soviet period."--Sheila Fitzpatrick, author of <em>Everyday Stalinism</em><p></p><br>"<em>Stalinist Perpetrators</em> draws back the curtain on how the Stalinist Terror actually operated--not just how the state ordered it, but how it happened in provincial offices and prison cells. Her subject is the 'purge of the purgers,' the trial and often execution of the men responsible for the Terror. The nature of her source material--voluminous case files on these accused individuals--allows her to reconstruct the process and practices of the Stalinist Terror, including the beatings and torture, at the level of individuals, both in Kyiv and in more mundane provincial cities."--Peter Holquist, author of <em>Making War, Forging Revolution: Russia's Continuum of Crisis, 1914-1921</em><p></p><br>"The Stalinist purges of the late 1930s stand as one of the most horrific episodes of state terror in the twentieth century. Yet the perpetrators of those crimes have remained anonymous for many decades, protected mainly by the rules of historical access in Russia. Now, Lynne Viola, working in Ukrainian archives, provides the first remarkable study of the perpetrators. In this groundbreaking book, we see for the first time who these individuals were, their backgrounds, what brought them to their position of life and death decisions, what life was like for them and their families during such a time. Most important, Viola examines with keen and dispassionate acumen how Stalin's murderers justified the torture and killing of hundreds of thousands of their fellow citizens. This is a disturbing book, and one that needs to be read."--David Shearer, author of <em>Stalin and the Lubianka: A</em> <em>Documentary History of the Political Police and Security Organs in the Soviet Union, 1922-1953</em><p></p><br>"The story of Stalin's terror is well known, except for one dimension: the fate of those among the tormentors who were themselves swept into the meat grinder. As well as lifting the cover from this less well-known part of the story, Viola explains in great detail the interaction between what was commanded from above and what flowed from forces at the ground level."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em><p></p><br>"Viola masterfully guides us through the voluminous mass of trial testimonies, leveraging the biased and self-serving evidence to reach measured conclusions . . . Thought-provoking, judicious analysis of revelatory new materials from the Kiev archives." --Michael David-Fox, <em>Russian Review</em><p></p><br>"A pioneering work . . . Viola critically examines interrogation protocols, witness testimonies, autopsy reports, and many other legal records, and thus succeeds in telling two stories in one book . . . She is interested in the practical implementation of terror and the mindset of those responsible for it and the book lives up to this claim." -- Immo Rebitschek, <em>Revolutionary Russia</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p><p>The classical partial differential equations of mathematical physics, formulated by the great mathematicians of the 19th century, remain today the basis of investigation into waves, heat conduction, hydrodynamics, and other physical problems.<br>In this comprehensive treatment by a well-known Soviet mathematician, the equations are presented and explained in a manner especially designed to be accessible to the novice in the field. The reader is assumed to have no previous knowledge other than elementary analysis. From there, more advanced concepts are developed in detail and with great precision; moreover, theorems are often approached through the study of special simpler cases, before being proved in their full generality, and are applied to many particular physical problems.<br>After deriving the fundamental equations, the author provides illuminating expositions of such topics as Riemann's method, Lebesgue integration of multiple integrals, the equation of heat conduction, Laplace's equation and Poisson's equation, the theory of integral equations, Green's function, Fourier's method, harmonic polynomials and spherical functions, and much more.<br>For this third edition, various improvements in style and clarifications of the presentations were made, including a simplification of the theory of multiple Lebesgue integrals and greater precision in the proof of the Fourier method. Finally, the translation is both idiomatic as well as accurate, making the vast amount of information in this book more readily accessible to the English reader.</p></p><p>Soviet mathematician Sergei L.

Whereas other books combine practical writing instruction with communication theory, MacRae&#x2019;s background as a journalist comes through in his concise approach: he hones in on the core genres and skills that all professional writers must develop as part of their writing repertoires. This book practices what it teaches. Concepts are explained and illustrated clearly and efficiently. The strong section on grammar clearly explains the basics that need to be in every professional writer&#x2019;s toolkit.

This is a practical, no-nonsense approach to professional writing. What the reader will find here is everything he or she needs to know to be an effective communicator, from a foundation in grammar and basic precepts, including the importance of document design, to how to write in specific professional genres, including persuasive letters, r�sum�s, and reports. Rather than being relegated to an appendix, grammar is foregrounded, along with the &#x2018;seven Cs of good professional communication.&#x2019; The coverage is thorough yet concise, and even experienced writers will find the text to be a valuable resource.&#x201d; &#x2015; <strong>Michael Fox, Western University</strong> </p></p><h2>Rewriting the Soul</h2><p><p>Twenty-five years ago one could list by name the tiny number of multiple personalities recorded in the history of Western medicine, but today hundreds of people receive treatment for dissociative disorders in every sizable town in North America. Clinicians, backed by a grassroots movement of patients and therapists, find child sexual abuse to be the primary cause of the illness, while critics accuse the "MPD" community of fostering false memories of childhood trauma. Here the distinguished philosopher Ian Hacking uses the MPD epidemic and its links with the contemporary concept of child abuse to scrutinize today's moral and political climate, especially our power struggles about memory and our efforts to cope with psychological injuries.</p><br><p> What is it like to suffer from multiple personality? Most diagnosed patients are women: why does gender matter? How does defining an illness affect the behavior of those who suffer from it? And, more generally, how do systems of knowledge about kinds of people interact with the people who are known about? Answering these and similar questions, Hacking explores the development of the modern multiple personality movement. He then turns to a fascinating series of historical vignettes about an earlier wave of multiples, people who were diagnosed as new ways of thinking about memory emerged, particularly in France, toward the end of the nineteenth century. Fervently occupied with the study of hypnotism, hysteria, sleepwalking, and fugue, scientists of this period aimed to take the soul away from the religious sphere. What better way to do this than to make memory a surrogate for the soul and then subject it to empirical investigation?</p><br><p> Made possible by these nineteenth-century developments, the current outbreak of dissociative disorders is embedded in new political settings. <i>Rewriting the Soul</i> concludes with a powerful analysis linking historical and contemporary material in a fresh contribution to the archaeology of knowledge. As Foucault once identified a politics that centers on the body and another that classifies and organizes the human population, Hacking has now provided a masterful description of the politics of memory : the scientizing of the soul and the wounds it can receive.</p></p><p><p>"There is little Mr. Hacking leaves untouched. His book ranges from history, science and philosophical rumination to amused reflections on daily life with equal authority and grace.

The incorporated revisions grew out of the authors' decade and more of classroom experience. Revisions were also made in accordance with recommendations proposed by instructors who have used the <i>Learn Japanese</i> series. The new edition, which reflects recent trends in language teaching, continues to emphasize an integrated approach in which speaking, hearing, reading, and writing Japanese all contribute to the language learning process.<br><br>- The most significant improvement is the addition of Culture Notes to help clarify the sociolinguistic context in which the language is used. Since Japanese modes of communication are highly situational, the student of Japanese needs to be made aware of the different contexts in which speakers interact. Culture Notes, used in conjunction with Grammar Notes, Dialogs, and Useful Expressions, show how an understanding of cultural values and human relationships can enhance the student's mastery of language skills.<br>- A new approach to language learning is used throughout the revised edition. The new sociolinguistic approach (which encourages the "generation of discourse") is integrated with the original pattern approach (which encourages the "generation of sentences").<br>- Many components of the first edition, such as Sentence Patterns, Grammar Notes, and Reviews, have been revised and/or rearranged.

Susan was a renowned scholar, teacher, mentor, and academic leader. She was recognized internationally for her work on how people regulate their feelings and emotions and how particular patterns of thinking can make people vulnerable to and recover slowly from emotional problems, especially depression. Her research shaped the field&#x2019;s perspective on depression in women and girls, and countless empirical studies and theoretical contributions followed as she developed her groundbreaking theory of rumination and depression. In her words: &#x201c;My career has focused on two parallel goals. The first is to use empirical methods to address important social and mental health problems (depression, rumination, women&#x2019;s mental health). The second goal is to disseminate psychological science. I also believe in taking science to the public, through my textbook on Abnormal Psychology and books for the general public on women&#x2019;s mental health.&#x201d; Susan taught at Stanford University, the University of Michigan, and Yale University.Susan&#x2019;s work focused on depression, mood-regulation, and gender, for which she was recognized and received the David Shakow Early Career Award from Division 12, the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Committee on Women of American Psychological Association, the James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science, a Research Career Award, and multiple grants from the National Institute of Mental Health. In addition, she was the founding editor of the Annual Review of Clinical Psychology, now the most highly cited journal in the field of clinical psychology. In addition to being an accomplished professor, scholar, teacher, and writer, Susan was a loving and devoted mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend, and mentor. Susan touched and inspired the lives of many people both professionally and personally, and she will be dearly missed.</p><h2>Shame and Guilt (Emotions and Social Behavior)</h2><p>Shame and guilt, while the focus of attention among scholars and clinicians for generations, have only recently been subjected to systematic empirical scrutiny. This volume reports on the growing body of knowledge on these key self-conscious emotions, integrating findings from the authors&#39; original research program with other data emerging from social, clinical, personality, and developmental psychology. Writing in an engaging, accessible style, June Price Tangney and Ronda L. Dearing offer a coherent new scientific perspective on shame and guilt. Compelling evidence is presented to demonstrate that these universally experienced affective phenomena have significant--and surprisingly disparate--implications for many aspects of human functioning, with particular relevance for interpersonal relationships.</p><p>June Price Tangney, PhD, is Professor of Psychology at George Mason University. She received her doctorate in clinical psychology from the University of California-Los Angeles, under the direction of Dr. Seymour Feshbach, after working with Dr. Joseph Masling as an undergraduate at the State University of New York at Buffalo. Dr. Tangney serves on the editorial boards of several professional journals. Her research has been funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the John Templeton Foundation.<br><br>Ronda L. Dearing, PhD, is a Postdoctoral Associate at the Research Institute on Addictions in Buffalo, New York. She became involved in the study of shame and guilt during her graduate training in clinical psychology at George Mason University, while working as a research assistant with June Tangney. Prior to her training in psychology, Dr. Dearing worked as a medical technologist. Her doctoral dissertation focused on predictors of psychotherapy help-seeking in therapists-in-training. More recent interests include help-seeking in substance abuse, substance abuse treatment approaches, and the influence of shame-proneness on substance use.Contents<br><br>1.

Rosenthal brings together a lifetime of research and experience on state legislative politics into one eminently readable volume - a dynamic, inside view of the people involved, the politics that prevail, and the interest groups and lobbyists who advocate their causes. Building on earlier work with new data and recent interviews and observations, Rosenthal looks at the way representation works, Americans&#39; critical view of their legislatures, the role of legislative leaders, the dynamics of executive-legislative relationships, as well as norms and ethics. Both a complement and contrast to the policymaking process on Capitol Hill, Engines of Democracy proves that no one gives insight into state legislators and their work the way Alan Rosenthal can.</p><p><p><b>Alan Rosenthal</b> is Professor of Public Policy and Political Science at the Eagleton Institute of Politics, Rutgers University.

This new edition updates this first-rate guide to what should be in all our minds. (Christopher Chippindale, Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology)<br><br><i>Archaeological Ethics</i> is a central text for our discipline and represents our global engagement with archaeology's many, diverse stakeholders. (Lynn Meskell, Stanford University)<br><br>Amongst practicing archaeologists, K. D. Vitelli is the premier scholar of archaeological ethics, and her student Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh is following closely in her footsteps. Together they have put together a wholly revised second edition of <i>Archaeological Ethics</i> that is sure to become a standard handbook for both teachers and researchers. The range of articles in the book includes both the classical statements of issues as well as new considerations and theoretical developments, formulated neatly along with presentations of concrete examples of doing archaeology well at the same time that archaeologists 'do good.' Many members of the discipline, both Classical and New World archaeologists, have come to rely on Vitelli as a touchstone for understanding ethics in archaeology; needless to say, with her editorial work on this new volume, she has not let us down. (Anne Pyburn, Indiana University)<br><br>Issues in archaeological ethics are rarely black and white; by avoiding simplistic answers to complex issues, this volume teaches rather than preaches. Instead of focusing on answers, it helps archaeologists ask the right questions. It covers a wide range of archaeological issues, and encourages reflection on the reasons underlying them. No archaeologist can afford to ignore the issues this volume addresses, neither can they afford to assume they know the answers to the questions it poses. Steal this book! (Alex Barker, Milwaukee Public Museum)<br><br>The second edition of <i>Archaeological Ethics</i> is as enthralling, timely, and effective for teaching purposes as was the first. Beginning, in the Introduction, with a philosophical discussion of morals and ethics, subsequent chapters consider the facts and the problems of excavations, legal and illegal, in many parts of the world. While perhaps intended for archaeologists, this book provides an invaluable resource for all those who study and teach the history and peoples of the past. (Clemency Coggins, Boston University)<br><br>Vitelli and Colwell-Chanthaphonh have done an outstanding job updating an already significant collection of essays related to archaeological ethics. The authors address a wide span of issues that are relevant to the discipline. This volume is a major contribution to the field and it should become a standard text in the field. It is a must read for students and scholars. (Paul A. Shackel, director, Center for Heritage Resource Studies, University of Maryland)<br><br>With case-studies from around the world, this book demonstrates that archaeology is a field of considerable political currency. Topics discussed include, among many others, the rights and interests of indigenous people; demands for the reburial and repatriation of archaeological finds; looting, fakes, and the ethics of collecting; the archaeology of a Nazi extermination site; archaeologists as secret agents; saving cultural heritage in Afghanistan and Iraq; archaeology and religious fundamentalism; and the depiction of prehistory in Jean Auel's bestselling novels. Well-written throughout, each case-study engages readers far more than the usual academic writing. Challenging questions for discussion after each chapter make <i>Archaeological Ethics</i> an ideal textbook. The book is essential reading for students of many fields within the humanities and social sciences, and it will intrigue a general audience about the politics of the past in the modern world. (Cornelius Holtorf, University of Lund, Sweden)<br><br>Articles are well-written....Both volumes present important analyses and case studies of ethical issues facing our discipline today.

Are you clueless as to why one paragraph just seems to "flow" while you simply can't recall the contents of another? Guess what: you are not alone. Even the best writers fail to grasp why their writing works. <i>The Reader's Brain</i> is the first science-based guide to writing, employing cutting-edge research on how our minds process written language, to ensure your writing can be read quickly, assimilated easily, and recalled precisely - exactly what we need to transform anyone into a highly effective writer. Using the 5Cs - clarity, continuity, coherence, concision, and cadence - this book combines irreverent humor with easy-to-follow principles that will make readers perceive your sentences, paragraphs, and documents to be clear, concise, and effective.</p><p>The first comprehensive, science-based approach to writing, The Reader&#39;s Brain employs neuroscience, psychology, and psycholinguistics to provide easy-to-follow principles for writing clearly and effectively. The book provides students and professionals from any field with the tools to write highly readable documents - from papers to proposals.I spent the first half-dozen years I taught undergraduate writing courses, haunted by the conviction that I should refund my students' tuition at the end of each term. What made some sentences read as transparently and easily as glancing through a pane of glass, while others refused to make sense after a third rereading? Why did some writers turn out sentences that telegraphed authority, while others sounded like eight year-olds doing a crappy job on a book report? And, if books on writing had a recognizable methodology behind them, what the hell was it based on? <br><br>Wherever I looked, the scanty methodologies available were based on Aristotle's principles for oral arguments--hardly suitable for written arguments in a noisy, literate environment. Other pundits insisted on the importance of the process fledgling writers used for cranking out assignments. However, if you poked around the foundations of each approach, you ended up in the position of the woman who confronted William James after a lecture on cosmology.&nbsp; His whole theory was ridiculous, she said, insisting the universe rested on the back of a turtle. When James asked her what the turtle stood on, she answered, triumphantly, "It's turtles all the way down!" Books on writing had a "turtles all the way down" problem. Each book was based on the lore handed down by some predecessor, with only anecdotes by battered teachers from the trenches to shore up the advice. <br><br>But I came to writing from some thoroughly peculiar directions. I wrote one of the first dissertations on reading and hypertext, which threw me directly into the thick of some of the best research on the way our brains process written language. I spent my doctoral career immersed in cognitive and developmental psychology, psycholinguistics, and neuroscience, extrapolating from the clinical data principles about what made texts hang together. I also spent my earliest years as a professor simultaneously working in advertising for clients that included Cunard, GlaxoSmithKline, ICL, and Abbott Laboratories. My writing had to be readable, accessible, and make readers recall its most important points, from brochures hawking world cruises to white papers on vaccines. As a result, my approach to teaching writing became highly pragmatic. And, when I started teaching clinicians in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida, I needed a science-based methodology to convince skeptical doctors that I actually had something valuable to teach them. At that moment, I connected the utility of the data that had fueled my early research with a science-based approach to teaching writing. In addition to being easy to follow and backed by decades of empirical data, the principles I evolved appealed strongly to scientists and students who crunched numbers and were more comfortable with data than words.<br><br>This book is for those of us who (a) wondered what we were supposed to be learning in those required writing courses, (b) always wanted to know why some sentences paragraphs just seemed to work, (c) demand empirical evidence for following directions, (d) need a comprehensive, one-stop guide to writing effectively. Look no further--you've got the answers in your hand.</p><h2>Victimology: Legal, Psychological, and Social Perspectives</h2><p><p> <b> <i>Victimology: Legal, Psychological, and Social Perspectives, 4e </i> </b>is a student-friendly, easy-to-read text that covers the field of victimology. Fully updated with the latest trends, it reflects the field&#x2019;s growing focus on the entire victim-offender relationship, while taking a global perspective on the study of victimology. The text is divided into four major areas. The authors first introduce traditional victimology theories, the measurement of crime, and both civil and criminal processes. (Civil process is included because it is an important aspect of the victim&#x2014;offender interaction.) Second, they discuss responses to victimization, including techniques for empowering victims. They next turn to special types of victims, including the elderly, the disabled, and gay and lesbian victims. Finally, they thoroughly review the civil remedies available to crime victims. A brief discussion of the juvenile system is also included because more attention is being focused on youth violence. Throughout the text, key concepts are supported with a comprehensive package of pedagogical material and teaching/learning aids.</p></p><p></p><h2>Roman Social History: A Sourcebook</h2><p>This <em>Sourcebook </em>contains a comprehensive collection of sources on the topic of the social history of the Roman world during the late Republic and the first two centuries AD. <p>Designed to form the basis for courses in Roman social history, this excellent resource covers original translations&nbsp;from sources such as inscriptions, papyri, and legal texts.

There appeared to be no way to reconcile the new theory of quantum mechanics with Einstein's theory of relativity. Several approaches had been tried and had failed. In the post-World War II period, four eminent physicists rose to the challenge and developed a calculable version of quantum electrodynamics (QED), probably the most successful theory in physics. This formulation of QED was pioneered by Freeman Dyson, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger, and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, three of whom won the Nobel Prize for their work. In this book, physicist and historian Silvan Schweber tells the story of these four physicists, blending discussions of their scientific work with fascinating biographical sketches.</p><br><p> Setting the achievements of these four men in context, Schweber begins with an account of the early work done by physicists such as Dirac and Jordan, and describes the gathering of eminent theorists at Shelter Island in 1947, the meeting that heralded the new era of QED. The rest of his narrative comprises individual biographies of the four physicists, discussions of their major contributions, and the story of the scientific community in which they worked. Throughout, Schweber draws on his technical expertise to offer a lively and lucid explanation of how this theory was finally established as the appropriate way to describe the atomic and subatomic realms.</p></p><p><b>Silvan S. Schweber</b> is Professor of Physics and Richard Koret Professor of the History of Ideas at Brandeis University. He is also an associate in the Department of the History of Science at Harvard University."A remarkable and exciting book. . . .

Essential reading for students of social science research, this book traces theories from their most rudimentary building blocks (terminology and definitions) through multivariable theoretical statements, models, the role of creativity in theory building, and how theories are used and evaluated. Authors Pamela J. Shoemaker, James William Tankard, Jr., and Dominic L. Lasorsa intend to improve research in many areas of the social sciences by making research more theory-based and theory-oriented.The book begins with a discussion of concepts and their theoretical and operational definitions. It then proceeds to theoretical statements, including hypotheses, assumptions, and propositions.&nbsp; Theoretical statements need theoretical linkages and operational linkages; this discussion begins with bivariate relationships, as well as three-variable, four-variable, and further multivariate relationships.&nbsp; The authors also devote chapters to the creative component of theory-building and how to evaluate theories.How to Build Social Science Theories is a sophisticated yet readable analysis presented by internationally known experts in social science methodology. It is designed primarily as a core text for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in communication theory. It will also be a perfect addition to any course dealing with theory and research methodology across the social sciences. Additionally, professional researchers will find it an indispensable guide to the genesis, dissemination, and evaluation of social science theories.</p><p>Pamela Shoemaker (Ph.D., University of Wisconsin, 1982) is the John Ben Snow Professor, an endowed research chair at the S.I.

A wide range of practical material includes coverage of plates, beams, shells, bending, torsion, vibrations of rods, impact, and more.</p><p>In addition to his work on elasticity, Augustus Edward Hough Love (1863&#x2013;1940) studied wave propagation and was awarded the prestigious Adams Prize in 1911 for his development of a mathematical model of surface waves known as Love waves.</p><h2>Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World</h2><p>Abraham Pais' <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em>--the award-winning biography of Albert Einstein--received high acclaim from <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> which hailed it as "a monument to sound scholarship and graceful style," and from <em>The Christian Science Monitor</em> which called it "an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary man."<br> In his groundbreaking new book, Pais chronicles the history of the physics of matter and physical forces since the discovery of x-rays. He relates not only <em>what</em> has happened over the last one-hundred years, but also <em>why</em> it happened the way it did, the experiences of the scientists involved, and how a series of seemingly bizarre or unrelated occurrences has emerged as a logical sequence of discoveries and events. Personally involved in many of the developments described, Pais provides unique insights into the world of big and small physics, revealing how the smallest distances explored between 1895 and 1983 have shrunk a hundred millionfold. Along this "road inward," scientists have made advances that later generations will rank among the principal monuments of the twentieth century.<br> This magisterial survey explores the discoveries made on the constituents of matter, the laws that govern them, and the forces that act on them. Demonstrating the sometimes rocky road to new insights, Pais reveals that these have been times of progress and stagnation, of order and chaos, of clarity and confusion, of belief and incredulity, of the conventional and the bizarre, as well as of revolutionaries and conservatives, of science by individuals and by consortia, of little gadgets and big machines, and of modest funds and big moneys.<br></p><p><br><strong>Abraham Pais</strong> is Detlev W.

The committee has done an excellent job, but its report is as noteworthy for what it omits as for what it says. It identifies and analyzes with great insight and clarity deficiencies in the quality of our present medical care delivery system, and it is persuasive in outlining how the system ought to work. But it does not say much about the fundamental causes of those deficiencies. Nor does it address the central question: Can we really ``cross the quality chasm'' in medical care without major reform of the whole system? <p> The committee's earlier report, To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System (Linda T. Kohn, Janet M. Corrigan, and Molla S. Donaldson, eds. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1999), was released in the fall of 1999. The report created an immediate sensation with its estimate of 44,000 to 98,000 deaths annually due to errors in hospital care, which it said were due more to error-prone institutional systems than to mistakes by individual health care workers. Predictably, the report launched a spate of governmental and private projects to study the cause and reporting of such events and the means of preventing them. The committee's second report moves beyond the initial focus on medical mishaps and takes a broader look at other problems with the quality of health care. It suggests, in general terms, a variety of ways in which the effectiveness and efficiency of health care should be improved. The report is thoughtful, painstaking, and totally reasonable, and yet it has attracted much less attention than its predecessor. </p><p> Why hasn't Crossing the Quality Chasm had more impact? I think there are several reasons. First, it contains nothing nearly so sensational as the claim made in the first report that tens of thousands of deaths are caused by medical errors. Second, most of the problems in our health care system that are identified in the second report have been widely recognized for some time. For example, as important causes of reduced quality, the report cites fragmentation of responsibility and lack of continuity in the care of individual patients. It describes the lack of coordination and communication among providers and between providers and patients. And it faults the system for not sufficiently employing electronic-information technology. It criticizes the system's failure to rely on evidence-based guidelines as standards for practice and faults providers for failing systematically to record and report outcomes. It also finds the current health care delivery system insufficiently responsive to the needs of patients and not sufficiently accountable to payers or patients. All these problems are certainly important. But they have been described before, and this report offers little that is substantive in the way of new and practical ways to solve them. This omission is probably the chief reason for the lukewarm reception given this study. </p><p> Granted, the study calls for greater attention to the need for improving the quality of care. It calls for workshops, more research and education, a reexamination of current payment methods, and many other general initiatives of this kind. It urges Congress to establish a ``Health Care Quality Innovation Fund'' to support projects on the improvement of quality, and it estimates that something ``on the order of $1 billion over 3 to 5 years'' would be needed. The report also suggests that the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality should identify ``not fewer than 15 priority conditions'' and should convene a meeting to ``develop strategies, goals, and action plans for achieving substantial improvements in quality in the next 5 years for each of the priority conditions.'' But these recommendations, however well intended, do not go to the heart of the matter, and they offer little in the way of fundamental solutions. </p><p> In fairness to the committee's meticulous and scholarly work, I should acknowledge that it did not set out to ``recommend specific organizational approaches to achieve the aims set forth.'' The committee was no doubt asked instead to concentrate on general aims, to suggest principles and guidelines for improving the quality of care, rather than confront the controversies that would result from suggesting basic reforms in the organization of the health system. </p><p> So, what is wrong with the organization of our present health care system that accounts for its problems with quality? In my view, the central problem is that the system is being directed mainly by market forces, which are as ill suited to the achievement of the quality goals envisioned in this report as they are to the attainment of the equally important goals of cost control and universal access. The notion that health care is basically an economic commodity represents a radical change from earlier assumptions about the social purpose of health care. It has gained currency only during the past 10 to 20 years, but it has already produced public policies that are rapidly converting our health care system into a vast competitive marketplace. We now have a large and growing sector of health care delivery controlled by private business, to a degree unmatched in any other nation. </p><p> As is the case with other markets in the U.S. economy, the part of medical service that is privately insured is distributed primarily according to the ability to pay. The multiple independent private insurers (mostly investor-owned) constantly seek to reduce their payments to providers and their financial obligations to sick patients. Similar economic pressures and incentives are at work in the governmental half of the system. In all parts of the system, the providers of care (i.e., hospitals and physicians) see themselves as competing businesses struggling to survive in a hostile economic climate, and they act accordingly. The predictable result is a fragmented, inefficient, and expensive system that neglects those who cannot pay, scrimps on the support of public health services and medical education, and has all of the deficiencies in quality that are so well described and analyzed in this report. It is a system that responds more to the financial interests of investors, managers, and employers than to the medical needs of patients. </p><p> The best way to achieve substantial improvements in the quality of care, I believe, would be to change the system. Unfortunately, the committee does not say that. It concentrates instead on suggestions for modifying behavior in the current system. However, the prospects for persuading participants caught up in the present commercially dominated system to behave in a more socially responsible way are not very good. I suspect most members of the committee know that but that they felt constrained by the terms of their charge to focus on incremental improvements in the quality of the present system. Given those constraints, they have done all that could have been expected, and they have done it very well. A more definitive approach to the problems they address must await major reforms in the health care system. </p><p> <i>Arnold S. Relman, M.D.</i> <br> Copyright � 2001 Massachusetts Medical Society.

Successful in hardback, it is now available in paperback for a student audience.</p><p><p>Anthony David Stephen Smith was a British historical sociologist who, at the time of his death, was Professor Emeritus of Nationalism and Ethnicity at the London School of Economics. He is considered one of the founders of the interdisciplinary field of nationalism studies.</p>"The scope of Smith's work is breathtaking ... Part I is in some respects the most original part of the book; to my knowledge there is no comparable survey." <i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i> <p>"Unquestionably an important contribution to the literature on nationalism ... this is a thoughtful, insightful investigation into the roots and strengths of ethnonational identity. ...

This study traces the evolution of the female labor force in America, addressing the issue of gender distinction in the workplace and refuting the notion that women's employment advances were a response to social revolution rather than long-run economic progress. Employing innovative quantitative history methods and new data series on employment, earnings, work experience, discrimination, and hours of work, it establishes that the present economic status of women evolved gradually over the last two centuries and that past conceptions of women workers persist.<br></p><p>Claudia Goldin is at Harvard University.<br>"Goes a long way toward the reintegration of labor history into labor economics....Clearly demonstrates the importance of history in understanding the evolution and operation of labor markets...a primer on much of modern labor economics."--<em>Journal of Economic History</em><p></p><br>"An excellent historical overview of women in the labor force.

However, the commonly used indicators of economic success such as per capita income are at best crude measures of the quality of life. There is a strong need for a systematic exploration of the content, reach, and relevance of the concept of the quality of life, and ways of making it concrete and usable. In this collection of essays, some leading economists and philosophers rise to that challenge and provide a wide-ranging investigation. The essays include examinations of recent attempts to replace incomes and utilities by the concept of capability and also an exploration of the classic Aristotelian accounts of human flourishing, which provide insights into capability-based assessment of the quality of life. Some underlying methodological problems are also examined, including cultural relativism and utility as a measure of advantage. Possibilities of application are discussed in the context of important practical problems, such as correcting gender-based inequalities, determining medical priorities, and promoting living standards. The overall result is a major contribution to the understanding and use of the idea of the quality of life.<br></p><p>In this book, leading philosophers and economists address issues of defining and measuring the quality of life. Recent developments in the philosophical definition of well-being are discussed and linked to practical issues such as the delivery of health care, and the assessment of women&#39;s quality of life.Martha Nussbaum is at Brown University.

Cyberbullying. Narcissism. Social media has become the dominant force in young people's lives, and each day seems to bring another shocking tale of private pictures getting into the wrong hands, or a lament that young people feel compelled to share their each and every thought with the entire world. Have smartphones and social media created a generation of self obsessed egomaniacs?<br><br>Absolutely not, Donna Freitas argues in this provocative book. And, she says, these alarmist fears are drawing attention away from the real issues that young adults are facing. <br><br>Drawing on a large scale survey and interviews with students on thirteen college campuses, Freitas finds that what young people are overwhelmingly concerned with what they really want to talk about is happiness. They face enormous pressure to look perfect online not just happy, but blissful, ecstatic, and fabulously successful. Unable to achieve this impossible standard, they are anxious about letting the less than perfect parts of themselves become public. Far from wanting to share everything, they are brutally selective when it comes to curating their personal profiles, and worry obsessively that they might unwittingly post something that could come back to haunt them later in life. Through candid conversations with young people from diverse backgrounds, Freitas reveals how even the most well adjusted individuals can be stricken by self doubt when they compare their experiences with the vast collective utopia that they see online. And sometimes, as on anonymous platforms like Yik Yak, what they see instead is a depressing cesspool of racism and misogyny. Yet young people are also extremely attached to their smartphones and apps, which sometimes bring them great pleasure. It is very much a love hate relationship.<br><br>While much of the public's attention has been focused on headline grabbing stories, the everyday struggles and joys of young people have remained under the radar. Freitas brings their feelings to the fore, in the words of young people themselves. <em>The Happiness Effect </em>is an eye opening window into their first hand experiences of social media and its impact on them.<br></p><p><br><strong>Donna Freitas</strong> is a Nonresident Research Associate at the University of Notre Dame's Center for the Study of Religion and Society, and when she is not traveling for research she teaches in the Honors Colleges at Hofstra University.

Bridging the disciplines of anthropology and biology, it acknowledges that human beings are vertebrates, mammals, and primates, and that the anatomical systems of the human body reflect adaptations from each of these levels of classification. John H. Langdon identifies the significance of those traits that make humans distinct from other vertebrates, exploring adaptations to the musculoskeletal, nervous, and reproductive systems and to systems of homeostasis. He addresses the question: "What functions are represented in the body structure and what history lies behind them?" Framing the answers in terms of physiological goals, functional adaptation, and evolutionary contingency, he covers both soft- and hard-tissue systems. Langdon considers how behavioral changes in our ancestors--bipedalism and a changing diet that incorporated meat--relate to anatomical changes in nearly every organ system and contributed to expansion of the brain, a higher energy budget, and a prolongation of life history. <br> Integrating the most recent research in the field, <em>The Human Strategy</em> features more than 250 clear and well-labeled illustrations that explain anatomical systems and processes. It includes tables that detail the differences between the major classes of vertebrates, helping students to put evolutionary variations among species in context. A comprehensive glossary and an extensive bibliography are also provided. Ideal for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in human evolutionary anatomy, <em>The Human Strategy</em> can also be used in human anatomy and human evolution courses. Taking a more complete look at the human body in an evolutionary sense than any other existing text--and demonstrating that the human present is best understood in terms of our past--this volume serves as an excellent starting point for discussion, critical thinking, and further research.<br></p><p>John H.

Distinguishing itself amid the media maelstrom that has homogenized Palestinians as "terrorists," this important new work offers a complex, nuanced, and humanized depiction of a group rendered invisible despite its substantial size, now accounting for nearly twenty percent of Israel's population. Groundbreaking and thought-provoking, <i>Birthing the Nation </i>contextualizes the politics of reproduction within contemporary issues affecting Palestinians, and places these issues against the backdrop of a dominant Israeli society.</p><p>"<i>Birthing the Nation</i> provides the first serious and comprehensive treatment of an issue full of intense meaning. Kanaaneh sets her unique study against a backdrop of Israeli political arithmetic, Palestinian subordination, nationalism, gender culture, globalization and modernity. Women's bodies and reproductive potential are the sites on which this demographic contest is played out. Therefore, this book has relevance and resonance far beyond the ethnographic site."&#x2015;Julie Peteet, author of <i>Gender in Crisis: Women and the Palestinian Resistance Movement</i><br><br>"This well-written and theoretically informed book remains faithful to the reality of the politics of reproduction in Galilee-indeed to the reality of Galilee society. Throughout, the narrative rings true. Kanaaneh argues compellingly and convincingly that understanding reproductive behavior clarifies how Palestinians within Israel negotiate the tortured path of self-definition and definition."&#x2015;Rashid Khalidi, author of <i>Palestinian Identity: The Construction of a Modern National Consciousness</i> <br><br>"The [Palestinian-Israeli] conflict that shapes this book is sadly alive and indeed booming louder than ever. News broadcasts around the world almost daily report the rising death tolls. We urgently need to hear more feminist perspectives (both male and female) like Rhoda Kanaaneh's that seriously attend to the intersections of politics, 'race,' class, religion and gender. It is indispensable to anyone interested in struggles for justice and freedom, including those against racism and sexism, wherever they may occur."&#x2015;Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Arab League and author of <i>This Side of Peace</i><br><br>"<i>Birthing the Nation</i> shows how, in the case of Israel even more than elsewhere in the world, the demands of states and nations turn private decisions about families and bodies into political arithmetics of populations. Eschewing polemics, Kanaaneh uses detailed ethnography of households, bodies, consumption, sex, and gender in a Palestinian village in Israel to illuminate a crucial new piece of the puzzle of the politics of reproduction: the use of 'reproductive ranking' in negotiations of modernity."&#x2015;Lila Abu-Lughod, editor of <i>Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East</i><br><br>"At once a work of political demography, feminist inquiry, and anthropological reflection, <i>Birthing the Nation</i> demonstrates with passion and precision how and why the study of reproduction is also the study of social struggle and transformation. It is a 'must read' not only for students of anthropology, women's studies, and Middle Eastern studies, but for anyone interested in the ongoing project of modern nationalism which this study of reproductive politics so brilliantly illuminates."&#x2015;Rayna Rapp, coeditor of <i>Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction</i><b>Rhoda Ann Kanaaneh </b>is a Jean Monnet Fellow at the European University Institute's Robert Schuman Center for Advanced Studies and the Mediterranean Programme.</p><h2>Introduction to Econometrics, Global Edition</h2><p><p><i>For courses in introductory econometrics.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Engaging applications bring the theory and practice of modern econometrics to life</b></p><p>Ensure students grasp the relevance of econometrics with&nbsp;<b><i>Introduction to Econometrics&nbsp;</i></b>-- the text that connects modern theory and practice with motivating, engaging applications.

Like <em>A Dictionary of</em> <em>Irish Mythology</em> before it, this is a who's who and what's what of the epic Celtic sagas and tales. Predated only by Greek and Latin by virtue of the fact that the Celtic languages were not written until the early Christian era, Celtic mythology is a development from a far earlier oral tradition containing voices from the dawn of European civilization. The peoples of these Celtic cultures survive today on the western seaboard of Europe--the Irish, Manx, and Scots, who make up the Goidelic- (or Gaelic) speaking branch of Celts, and the Welsh, Cornish, and Brentons, who represent the Brythonic-speaking branch. And it is in these languages that their vibrant and fascinating mythology has been recorded and appreciated throughout the world. In his introduction, Ellis discusses the roles of these six cultures, the evolution (or demise) of the languages, and the relationship between the legends, especially the Irish and Welsh, the two major Celtic cultures. From Celtic legends have come not only the stories of Cuchulainn and Fionn MacCumhail, of Deidre of the Sorrows and the capricious Grainne, but the stories of the now world-famous Arthur, and the romantic tragedy of Tristan and Iseult.<br> An easy-to-read handbook, <em>The Dictionary of Celtic Mythology</em> presents a fascinating window to centuries of rich oral and written tradtion from the mists of Europe's origins.<br></p><p><p>The <i>Dictionary of Celtic Mythology</i> is a veritable who's who and what's what of the epic Celtic sagas and tales, from the stories of Cuchulainn and Fionn MacCumhail, to the world-famous Arthur and the romantic tragedy of Tristan and Iseult.</p>An easy-to-read handbook, the Dictionary of Celtic Mythology presents a fascinating window to centuries of rich oral and written tradition from the mists of Europe&#39;s origins.</p><h2>Objects, Abstraction, Data Structures and Design: Using C++</h2><p>Koffman and Wolfgang introduce data structures in the context of C++ programming.&nbsp; They embed the design and implementation of data structures into the practice of sound software design principles that are introduced early and reinforced by 20 case studies.&nbsp; Data structures are introduced in the C++ STL format whenever possible. &nbsp; Each new data structure is introduced by describing its interface in the STL. Next, one or two simpler applications are discussed then the data structure is implemented following the interface previously introduced. Finally, additional advanced applications are covered in the case studies, and the cases use the STL. <p>In the implementation of each data structure, the authors encourage students to perform a thorough analysis of the design approach and expected performance before actually undertaking detailed design and implementation. Students gain an understanding of why different data structures are needed, the applications they are suited for, and the advantages and disadvantages of their possible implementations.</p> <p>Case studies follow a five-step process (problem specification, analysis, design, implementation, and testing) that has been adapted to object-oriented programming. Students are encouraged to think critically about the five-step process and use it in &nbsp; their problem solutions. Several problems have extensive discussions of testing and include methods that automate the testing process. Some cases are revisited in later chapters and new solutions are provided that use different data structures.</p> <p>The text assumes a first course in programming and is designed for Data Structures or the second course in programming, especially those courses that include coverage of OO design and algorithms. A C++ primer is provided for students who have taken a course in another programming language or for those who need a review in C++. &nbsp; Finally, more advanced coverage of C++ is found in an appendix.</p> <p><b>Course Hierarchy:</b></p> <p>Course is the second course in the CS curriculum</p> <p>Required of CS majors</p> <p>Course names include Data Structures and Data Structures &amp; Algorithms</p></p><p><p>"It is a practical book with emphasis on real problems the programmers encounter daily." <br>&#x2015;Dr. Tim H.

Mesopotamia was the home of a succession of glorious civilizations--Sumeria, Babylonia, and Assyria--which flourished together for more than three millennia. Sumerian mathematicians devised the sixty-minute hour that still rules our lives; Babylonian architects designed the famed Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon; Assyrian kings and generals, in the name of imperialism, conducted some of the shrewdest military campaigns in recorded history. Readers will identify with the literary works of these civilizations, such as the Code of Hammurabi and the Epic of Gilgamesh, as they are carried across centuries to a period in time intimately entwined with the story of the Bible. Maps and line drawings provide examples of Mesopotamian geography, while other chapters present the Mesopotamian struggle to create civilized life in a fertile land racked by brutal conquest.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Bertman</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Classical Studies at the University of Windsor, Ontario and adjunct lecturer in art history at the University of Michigan, Dearborn. His publications include <em>Doorways Through Time: The Romance of Archaeology</em>.<br>Bertman, professor emeritus of classics at the University of Windsor, has made a useful contribution to Facts On File's Handbook to Life series. Covering the lives of Assyrians, Babylonians, and Sumerians from around 3500 to 500 B.C.E., the book is arranged topically, with chapters on geography, archaeology, government, religion, language and literature, arts, and daily life, among other subjects. Each chapter has citations to the extensive bibliography. Most of the works in the larger bibliography are technical and specialized, but a "Note to the Reader" lists several popular works that could be found in a larger public library. Bertman's writing is formal but accessible, with touches of dry humor. <p>Subsections within the chapters deal with more specific topics. In the chapter on government, there are capsule biographies of political leaders, mostly kings. The chapter on archaeology provides a list of archaeologists who have made major discoveries in the region. Gods and goddesses are described in the chapter on religion. There is an interesting concluding chapter about the legacy of Mesopotamia and how it endures. A brief section on Aramaic-speaking Chaldeans who migrated from an ancient village in Iraq to Detroit in the twentieth century suggests that the legacy is more alive than we realize. Bertman notes, too, how many archaeological sites have been put at risk by recent political and military actions in the region.</p><p>The book is illustrated with black-and-white photographs and line drawings, which should copy well. Appendixes include a chronological table and a list of museums with major Mesopotamian collections. A useful purchase for medium-sized to large public libraries and academic libraries with undergraduate Middle Eastern ancient history classes.</p><p> <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It assumes no prior knowledge of linguistic theory and little of elementary grammar. It will suit students coming to syntactic theory for the first time either as graduates or undergraduates. It will also be useful for those in fields such as computational science, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology who need a sound knowledge of current syntactic theory.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Adger</strong> is Reader in Linguistics at Queen Mary, University of London.

Each chapter includes excellent problem sets and a list of further readings... The author takes a lot of time to illustrate each derivation step by step, thus helping students to see the workings of a formal syntactic system. Another very positive characteristic is the approach to crosslinguistic variation, which is given consistently in terms of features. ... I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a text that presents minimalist syntax in a clear way and with data from a vast array of languages."--<em>Language</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Discrete Mathematical Structures (Classic Version) (Pearson Modern Classics for Advanced Mathematics Series)</h2><p><p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>This title is part of the Pearson Modern Classics series.

Finally Understanding Science So You Can Teach It series)</h2><p>Why is left right and right left in the mirror? Baffled by the basics of reflection and refraction? Wondering just how the eye works? If you have trouble teaching concepts about light that you don t fully grasp yourself, get help from a book that s both scientifically accurate and entertaining with Light. By combining clear explanations, clever drawings, and activities that use easy-to-find materials, this book covers what science teachers and parents need to know to teach about light with confidence. It uses ray, wave, and particle models of light to explain the basics of reflection and refraction, optical instruments, polarization of light, and interference and diffraction. There s also an entire chapter on how the eye works. Each chapter ends with a Summary and Applications section that reinforces concepts with everyday examples. Whether you need a deeper understanding of how light bends or a good explanation of why the sky is blue, you ll find Light more illuminating and accessible than a college textbook and certainly more fun.</p><p>... Each of the seven short chapters presents readers with a coherent tour of the basics of the study of light and optics. Readers are first urged t try simple activities to make the content that follows more intelligible. The style is light and conversational.... --Science Activities, Winter 2007<br><br>Light Topics Made Easy. The book, Light: Stop Faking It! Finally Understanding Science So You Can Teach It, is an easy-to-understand, information-packed book that contains hands-on examples, thorough explanations, and real-life examples of the science concepts of light. Within separate chapters, the book explains the topics of reflection and refraction, the electromagnetic spectrum, parabolic reflectors, polarized plight, diffraction, the workings of the human eye, and light at the atomic level. The way in which the topics are presented is noteworthy, as described below: To begin each chapter, the author, William C. Robertson, Ph. D., instructs the reader to demonstrate the concept, hands-on, for himself or herself, in the sections which he calls, 'Things to do before the science stuff'. For example, in the first chapter, he tells the reader to get a flashlight, a clear rectangular baking pan, and fill the pan with water. He instructs the reader to shine the light through the glass, then through the water, and observe the resulting 'bend' of the light. Then, he tells the reader to shine the light through the air, then the water, and again observe the 'bend' of the light. (Incidentally, these directions are accompanied by diagrams, so that the reader can proceed with confidence.) Then, the reader is instructed to compare the results. In each chapter, he follows the 'Things to do before the science stuff' with 'The science stuff', the place in which he explains the scientific reasons for what was observed during the hands-on demonstration. Continuing with the example above, he gives the reader easy-to-understand explanations of refraction and the index of refraction, including diagrams, and Snell's Law, complete with the formula. Each chapter ends with a 'Summary' in which Robertson succinctly recaps the concepts, followed by the 'Applications' section in which he tells how the topics in the chapter explain real-world phenomena. For the example above, he explains to the reader, complete with an illustration, how refraction causes one to see the 'mirage' of water on the road ahead on hot days. This National Science Teacher Association book is an enjoyable read, compared to a traditional textbook, and it is a good reference for any elementary school teacher or middle school teacher teaching the 'light' topics. It includes explanations of concepts, formulas, easy-to-duplicate demonstrations that lend themselves to inquiry-based exploration, good scientific models (diagrams), and funny cartoons, jokes and whimsical anecdotes. Scilinks topic names and codes are provided throughout the book to access additional teaching resources. This book promotes the Learning Cycle method of inquiry-based science teaching, and is based on the National Science Education Standards. --Reviewed by: Lisa G (Mechanicsburg, PA) on June 23, 2009</p><h2>We the People</h2><p><p><strong>Politics is relevant and participation matters&#x2015;now more than ever.</strong></p> With fresh insight from new coauthor Andrea Campbell,&nbsp;<em>We the People</em>, Twelfth High School Edition, once again sets the standard for showing students how government impacts their lives and why it matters who participates.

Compounding their confusion is the highly publicized struggle of the contemporary Indian for self-determination, lost land, cultural preservation, and fundamental human rights&#x2014;a struggle dramatized both by public acts of protest and by precedent-setting legal actions. More and more, the battles of American Indians are fought&#x2014;and won&#x2014;in the political arena and the courts.</p><p>American Indians, American Justice explores the complexities of the present Indian situation, particularly with regard to legal and political rights. It is the first book to present an overview of federal Indian law in language readably accessible to the layperson. Remarkably comprehensive, it is destined to become a standard sourcebook for all concerned with the plight of the contemporary Indian.</p><p>Beginning with an examination of the historical relationship of Indians and the courts, the authors describe how tribal courts developed and operate today, and how they relate to federal and state governments. They define such key legal concepts as tribal sovereignty and Indian Country. By comparing and contrasting the workings of Indian and non-Indian legal institutions, the authors illustrate how Indian tribes have adapted their customs, values, and institutions to the demands of the modern world. Describing the activities of attorneys and Indian advocates in asserting and defending Indian rights, they identify the difficulties typically faced by Indians in the criminal and civil legal arenas and explore the public policy and legal rights of Indians as regards citizenship, voting rights, religious freedom, and basic governmental services.</p></p><p>Vine Deloria, Jr. (1933&#x2013;2005), a Standing Rock Sioux, was active in Indian legal and political affairs for several decades.<br><br>Clifford M.

Bond</strong> received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana&#x2013;Champaign and is currently a professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M University. His research analyzes the policy making process and the operation of democracy in American politics. Specifically, he is interested in the interactions of American political institutions, especially Congress and the presidency, and how electoral motivations affect democratic responsiveness in American political institutions. He has published more than three-dozen chapters and journal articles on presidential-congressional relations, congressional elections, and public policy. He served as president of Pi Sigma Alpha, the national political science honor society from 2006&#x2013;2008, and president of the Southern Political Science Association, the oldest regional political science association from 2006&#x2013;2007. </p> <p></p><b> </b><p><b>Kevin B.

The authors effectively apply political science research in a way that is fresh and accessible to students and do so in a way that will make students think well beyond their preconceptions about politics. The chapter on elections is the most thorough and engaging treatment of presidential elections you will find in an introductory American politics textbook. </p> <p><strong>Jeffrey S. Peake</strong>, <em>Clemson University</em> </p> <p>Jon Bond and Kevin Smith&#x2019;s <em>Analyzing American Democracy</em> provides the most comprehensive and nuanced treatment of American political institutions and behavior to date. By drawing upon the most recent political science literature, the text encourages students to see American politics through a theoretical lens, and promotes a more generalized understanding of political concepts that transcend time and space. With stimulating real-world examples of the trade-offs, paradoxes, and competing ethical perspectives that are negotiated in a modern representative democracy, students become conversant and critically-engaged in the challenges confronting the country, and thus, become better citizens. </p> <p><strong>Sarah A. Fulton</strong>, <em>Texas A&amp;M University</em> </p> <p><em>Analyzing American Democracy</em> is one of the best American Government books on the market. Not only is it comprehensive in covering material across the vast spectrum of American politics, but it also has an interesting point of view: the idea that our expectations of government and its performance may not be entirely realistic. Bond and Smith have written a book that is accessible to undergraduate students, yet provides sufficient detail for professors to examine the nuances of American politics today. </p> <p><strong>Richard W. Waterman</strong>, <em>University of Kentucky</em> </p> <p>Nobody does a better job than Bond and Smith of integrating modern political science with a thoroughly up-to-date introduction to American government. Most of my students have already been exposed to an AP-style high school American government survey, and a text that is clearly more science than civics is exactly what they need at the college level. On top of that the writing has the wit, snap, and drive that keeps students reading and thinking in spite of themselves. </p> <p><strong>John R. Alford</strong>, <em>Rice University</em> </p> <p>Teaching a broad survey course that covers the breadth of American politics can be a daunting task for both instructors and students. Bond and Smith have organized what could be an overwhelming amount of information into a logical structure coupled with a straightforward, journalistic writing style that incorporates cutting-edge political science research with key political concepts. The result is a textbook that is truly an introduction to political science, not just civics or popular politics. </p> <p><strong>Amanda Friesen</strong>, <em>Indiana University&#x2013;Purdue University Indianapolis</em></p></p><h2>Secrets of the Teenage Brain: Research-Based Strategies for Reaching and Teaching Today&#x2032;s Adolescents</h2><p><p><strong><em>Cutting-edge research meets brain-friendly strategies for teaching adolescents!</em></strong></p><p>The revised and expanded edition of this hands-on guide helps unlock adolescent thinking and behavior by explaining the biological changes happening in the teenage brain.

He provides specific, inspiring examples of how some of today&#x2019;s enlightened companies are leveraging the power of Agile, including firms such as: Airbnb, Amazon, Etsy, Facebook, Google, Lyft, Menlo Innovations, Saab, Samsung, Spotify, Tesla, Uber, and Warby Parker. </p> <p> </p> <p> Drawing on lessons learned from these bold companies and his own ongoing practice, Denning demystifies Agile by providing three &#x201c;laws&#x201d; that make it practical and clear: </p> <p> </p> <p> � <b>The Law of the Small Team</b> shows how to operate in a &#x201c;VUCA&#x201d; world (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity). Using this law, difficult problems are split into manageable batches and performed by small cross-functional, self-governing teams, working iteratively in short cycles, with fast feedback from customers and end-users. </p> <p> </p> <p> � <b>The Law of the Customer</b> flows from the epic shift in power in the marketplace from seller to buyer, and the need for firms to radically accelerate their ability to make decisions and change direction in light of unexpected events and new customer demands. It amounts to a Copernican revolution in management. </p> <p> </p> <p> � <b>The Law of the Network</b> (the linchpin of Agile) illustrates what&#x2019;s involved in making the entire organization Agile. </p> <p> </p> <p> Becoming &#x201c;agile&#x201d; is a continuing journey, not a finite accomplishment. You&#x2019;ll know your company has joined the fray when its goal has shifted from creating profits to creating delighted customers. And you&#x2019;ll find that not focusing on &#x201c;making money&#x201d; . . . makes more money. </p> <p> </p> <p> Stephen Denning is a renowned Agile advocate who serves on the advisory board of the Drucker Forum.

The subsequent chapters reflect the wide geographical and temporal scope of Tantra by examining thirty-six texts from China, India, Japan, Nepal, and Tibet, ranging from the seventh century to the present day, and representing the full range of Tantric experience--Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, and even Islamic. Each text has been chosen and translated, often for the first time, by an international expert in the field who also provides detailed background material. Students of Asian religions and general readers alike will find the book rich and informative.</p><br><p> The book includes plays, transcribed interviews, poetry, parodies, inscriptions, instructional texts, scriptures, philosophical conjectures, dreams, and astronomical speculations, each text illustrating one of the diverse traditions and practices of Tantra. Thus, the nineteenth-century Indian Buddhist <i>Garland of Gems,</i> a series of songs, warns against the illusion of appearance by referring to bees, yogurt, and the fire of Malaya Mountain; while fourteenth-century Chinese Buddhist manuscripts detail how to prosper through the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper by burning incense, making offerings to scriptures, and chanting incantations. In a transcribed conversation, a modern Hindu priest in Bengal candidly explains how he serves the black Goddess Kali and feeds temple skulls lentils, wine, or rice; a seventeenth-century Nepalese Hindu praise-poem hammered into the golden doors to the temple of the Goddess Taleju lists a king's faults and begs her forgiveness and grace. An introduction accompanies each text, identifying its period and genre, discussing the history and influence of the work, and identifying points of particular interest or difficulty.</p><br><p> The first book to bring together texts from the entire range of Tantric phenomena, <i>Tantra in Practice</i> continues the Princeton Readings in Religions series. The breadth of work included, geographic areas spanned, and expert scholarship highlighting each piece serve to expand our understanding of what it means to practice Tantra.</p></p><p><b>David Gordon White</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

S. Eliot and His Context</h2><p>When <em>Discovering Modernism</em> was first published, it shed new and welcome light on the birth of Modernism. This reissue of Menand's classic intellectual history of T.S. Eliot and the singular role he played in the rise of literary modernism features an updated Afterword by the author, as well as a detailed critical appraisal of the progression of Eliot's career as a poet and critic. The new Afterword was adapted from Menand's critically lauded essay on Eliot in <em>The Cambridge History of Literary Criticism, Volume Seven: Modernism and the New Criticism</em>. Menand shows how Eliot's early views on literary value and authenticity, and his later repudiation of those views, reflect the profound changes regarding the understanding of literature and its significance that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. It will prove an eye-opening study for readers with an interest in the writings of T.S. Eliot and other luminaries of the Modernist era.<br></p><p><br><strong>Louis Menand</strong> is Professor of English and American Literature and Language at Harvard University and former Distinguished Professor of English at the City University of New York Graduate Center. He is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Metaphysical Club</em>, and is a well-known essayist and critic for the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine. His next work will feature the art and thought of the Cold War period from 1945 to 1965.<br>Marked with the rhetoric of the lecture hall, this book is nevertheless a penetrating analysis of the philosophical and critical context that enabled T. S. Eliot to compose "Tradition and the Individual Talent" and The Waste Land, the two works it discusses most thoroughly. Menand is particularly successful in demonstrating the continuity of 19th-century ideas, largely because of the abiding reputations of such critics as Walter Pater and William Hazlitt, thinkers who profoundly affected the work of Eliot and Ezra Pound. Menand's thesis is that Eliot correctly analyzed the contradictions inherent in Modernist thought and that his genius lay in transforming those very contradictions into "literary opportunities."

MacClaren, The Business Times</p><h2>The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe</h2><p>Covering a thousand years of history, this richly illustrated volume tells the story of the creation of Western civilization in Europe and the Mediterranean. Written by noted scholars and based on the latest research, it offers the most authoritative account of life in medieval Europe from the fall of the Roman Empire to the coming of the Renaissance.<br> Exploring a period of profound diversity and change, the contributors focus on all aspects of medieval history from the empires and kingdoms of Charlemagne and the Byzantines to the new nations which fought the Hundred Years War; from the expression of religion in the great monasteries and cathedrals to the mixed ambitions of the Crusades; and from the cultural worlds of chivalric knights, popular festivals, and new art forms to the social catastrophe of the Black Death. Divided between the Mediterranean world and northern Europe, the six chapters in this book demonstrate the movement of the center of gravity in European life from the Mediterranean to the north. With over two hundred illustrations, including dozens in color, the volume also contains comprehensive reference material in maps, genealogies, a chronology, lists of further reading, and a full index.<br></p><p><br>Now retired, George Holmes was Chichele Professor of Medieval History at the University of Oxford.<br>Holmes et al. have produced an attractive account of medieval Europe from the fall of Rome to the eve of the Reformation. This popular history, well-written by professional historians, is for the intelligent general reader. The book conveys a good sense of the movement of events and the succession of great people, and it catches the economic, social, and intellectual structures which underpinned events. Noteworthy among the well-conceived chapters is Malcolm Vale's discussion of "the eclipse of ecclesiastical power . . . especially papal power . . . and the expansion and elaboration of secular rule." Holmes concludes that this fragmented era laid the groundwork for the fertile period that followed. Maps, charts, and illustrations deserve high praise. Highly recommended.

If there is one single book that can be upheld as the common code of a whole people, it is perhaps <em>Lun Yu</em>, or <em>The Analects</em>. Surely, few individuals in history have shaped their country's civilization more profoundly than Master Kong. The great Han historiographer, Si-ma Qian, writing 2,100 years ago said, "He may be called the wisest indeed!" And, as recently as 1988, at a final session of the first international conference of Nobel prize-winners in Paris, the seventy-five participants, fifty-two of whom where scientists, concluded: "If mankind is to survive, it must go back twenty- five centuries in time to tap the wisdom of Confucius." This a man whose influence in world history is truly incomparable. His sayings (and those of his disciples) form the basis of a distinct social, ethical, and intellectual system. They have retained their freshness and vigor for two and a half millennia, and are still admired in today's China. <br> Compiled by pupils of Confucius's disciples half a century after the Master's death, <em>The Analects of Confucius</em> laid the foundation of his philosophy of humanity--a philosophy aimed at "cultivating the individual's moral conduct, achieving family harmony, bringing good order to the state and peace to the empire. Containing 501 very succinct chapters (the longest do not exceed fifteen lines and the shortest are less than one) and organized into twenty books, the collection comprises mostly dialogues between the Master and his disciples and contemporaries. The ethical tenets Confucius put forth not only became the norm of conduct for the officialdom and intelligentsia, but also profoundly impacted the behavior of the common people. The great sage's unique integration of humanity and righteousness (love and reason) struck a powerful chord in all who attempted to understand his moral philosophy. As translator Chichung Huang contends, "What ethical principle laid down by man could be more sensible that none which blends the best our heart can offer with the best our mind can offer as the guiding light for our conduct throughout our lives?" Ever timely, Confucius's teachings on humanity (family harmony in particular) and righteousness may well serve as a ready-made cure for today's ills in an era which human beings are blinded by force and lust, not unlike Confucius's own day. <br> Far more literal than any English version still in circulation, this brilliant new rendition of <em>The Analects</em> helps the reader not only to acquire and accurate and lucid understanding of the original text, but also to appreciate the imagery, imagery, parallelism, and concision of its classical style. The translator Chichung Huang, a Chinese scholar born in a family of Confucian teachers and schooled in one of the last village Confucian schools in South China, brings to this treasure of world literature a sure voice that captures the power and subtleties of the original. Vivid, simple, and eminently readable, this illuminating work makes the golden teachings of the sage of the East readily available to anyone in search of them.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Translator:</em><br> <strong>Chichung Huang</strong> was Professor of Chinese at Bennington College. He had previously taught at Peking University for three decades, two of which were spent in political exile, before coming to the United States.<br>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Chinese</p><h2>Fallproof!

Debates over these issues raged in the late nineteenth century as reformers introduced a new kind of university&#x2014;one dedicated to free inquiry and the advancement of knowledge. In the first major study of moral education in American universities, Julie Reuben examines the consequences of these debates for modern intellectual life.<br> <br> Based on extensive research at eight universities&#x2014;Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Stanford, Michigan, and California at Berkeley&#x2014;Reuben examines the aims of university reformers in the context of nineteenth-century ideas about truth. She argues that these educators tried to apply new scientific standards to moral education, but that their modernization efforts ultimately failed. By exploring the complex interaction between institutional and intellectual change, Reuben enhances our understanding of the modern university, the secularization of intellectual life, and the association of scientific objectivity with value-neutrality.<br></p></p><p></p><h2>Problems of the Self</h2><p>This is a volume of philosophical studies, centred on problems of personal identity and extending to related topics in the philosophy of mind and moral philosophy.</p><p>A collection of philosophical studies centered on problems of identity and extending to related topics in the philosophy of mind and moral philosophy.'This welcome volume contains fifteen papers by Bernard Williams, an especially stimulating and insightful philosopher ... His papers usually are admirably clear, and always reward careful and sustained study.' Journal of Philosophy<br><br>'To read only a few pages of [this excellent book] is to get a fine impression of the character, or flavour, of contemporary philosophy. A powerful feel for analogy allows various phenomena in turn (belief, desire, consistency) to be illuminated by considering both their resemblances to, and their differences from contiguous phenomena. There is an impatience with the trivial. And there is a constant sense, as in a Dutch landscape, of how the roads lead beyond the visible horizon. Added to this Williams exhibits on every page a mind of exceptional acuity. I doubt if anyone could read the reflections on immortality entitled 'The Makropulos Case' without a consciousness that his deepest beliefs and feelings were being engaged: engaged and adjusted under the influence of reason.

Richard Wollheim, The Listener</p><h2>Swarm Intelligence (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Evolutionary Computation)</h2><p><p>Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems have<br>privileged private "internal" cognitive and computational processes. In<br>contrast, <i>Swarm Intelligence</i> argues that human<br>intelligence derives from the interactions of individuals in a social world<br>and further, that this model of intelligence can be effectively applied to<br>artificially intelligent systems. The authors first present the foundations of<br>this new approach through an extensive review of the critical literature in<br>social psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They<br>then show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new<br>computational intelligence methodology&#x2015;particle swarms&#x2015;which focuses<br>on adaptation as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down<br>still further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying particle<br>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems.

The authors argue than human cognition has a goal: we pay attention only to information which seems to us relevant. To communicate is to claim someone's attention, and hence to imply that the information communicated is relevant. Thus, a single property - relevance is seen as the key to human communication and cognition.<br> </p> <p>A second important feature of the book is its approach to the study of reasoning. It elucidates the role of background or contextual information in spontaneous inference, and shows that non-demonstrative inference processes can be fruitfully analysed as a form of suitably constrained guesswork. It directly challenges recent claims that human central thought processes are likely to remain a mystery for some time to come.<br> </p> <p>Thirdly, the authors offer new insight into language and literature, radically revising current view on the nature and goals of verbal comprehension, and in particular on metaphor, irony, style, speech acts, presupposition and implicature.</p></p><p><i>Relevance,</i> first published in 1986, was named as one of the most important and influential books of the decade in the <i>Times Higher Educational Supplement.</i> This revised edition includes a new Preface outlining developments in Relevance Theory since 1986, discussing the more serious criticisms of the theory, and envisaging possible revisions or extensions.<b>Dan Sperber</b> of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris, and the Universit� de Paris X, is author of <i>Rethinking Symbolism</i> and <i>On Anthropological Knowledge.</i> <p> <b>Dierdre Wilson</b> is Reader in Linguistics at University College London, and the author of <i>Presuppositions and Non-Truth-Conditional Semantics</i> and <i>Modern Linguistics: The Results of Chomsky's Revolution.</i></p></p><h2>Applied Sport Mechanics</h2><p><p><i>Applied Sport Mechanics, Fourth Edition With Web Study Guide,</i> helps undergraduate students understand how the fundamental laws of human movement affect athletes&#x2019; performances.

Indeed, the most insolvable problems of crime and punishment are not so much who committed the crime, but how to see that justice is done. Now, in this illuminating volume, one of America's great legal thinkers, Norval Morris, addresses some of the most perplexing and controversial questions of justice in a highly singular fashion--by examining them in fictional form, in what he calls "parables of the law."<br> The protagonist of these stories, the figure who must see that justice is done, is Eric Blair, a name familiar to most readers: it's the real name of George Orwell. In fact, Morris has set his tales in the time and place of Orwell's famous essay, "Shooting an Elephant," in Moulmein, Burma, in the 1920s. What might seem a curious strategy at first glance--borrowing Orwell's persona to narrate these tales--is actually a brilliant stroke. For in Eric Blair we have an ideal narrator to highlight the complexities of justice: an untrained police lieutenant and junior magistrate, uncertain of judgement--and all the more likely to anguish over judgement, and to examine every facet of a case before deciding. And in 1920s Moulmein we have a neutral time and space in which to consider--free of our own political, religious, or social prejudices--a set of contemporary legal and moral questions that rarely find so calm an arena. And these stories certainly address some highly charged issues--capital punishment, insanity as a murder defense, the "battered wife syndrome" as a murder defense, child custody, "parental neglect" due to religious conviction--to name a few. In each tale, Norval Morris excels at placing Blair at the center of a controversy that has no easy answer, and that he and he alone must decide. In the title story, for instance, a retarded boy, whose only understanding of sex comes from the brothel in which he works, accidentally murders a young girl while raping her, his only defense being "Please sir, I paid her." Blair can see that the boy doesn't realize that he has committed a crime, but both the Burmese and the European community of Moulmein demand the boy's execution. Does capital punishment make sense in such an instance? Does it ever make sense? To broaden our understanding of these intricate cases, Morris concludes each story with a perceptive and often provocative commentary on each issue. After "Brothel Boy," for instance, Morris points out that <em>no</em> reputable study has ever shown capital punishment to be an effective deterrent to future murders, and more surprisingly, that paroled murderers commit proportionately fewer homicides than paroled felons who used a firearm in the commission of their crime.<br> Norval Morris is one of America's foremost experts on crime and punishment, and the stories collected here represent the culmination of a lifetime of thought on the major criminal law debates of our time. A reader of these tales will come away with a deeper understanding of these debates and with a profound respect for the intricacies of justice and the complexity of the law.<br></p><p><br><strong>Norval Morris</strong> is Julius Kreeger Professor of Law and Criminology at the University of Chicago.<br>"Studying knotty legal dilemmas by the case method is nothing new, but it surely has never been done so oddly and cleverly as in this most original book."--The Boston Globe<br><br>"An unforgettable work of fiction and interpretation....An undertaking of powerful ingenuity....More than just a high-minded exercise in academic precocity, The Brothel Boy has depth and bite. The parables explore earthy subjects--murder, madness, lust, adultery, child abuse, racial<br>animosity--and are packed with as much suspense as any hard-boiled detective novel"--Legal Times<br><br>"Exceptionally evocative....Compares favorably to Orwell's own 'Burma Days."--Chicago Tribune<br><br>"Provides a fascinating insight into the relationship between legal reasoning and societal values."--Criminal Justice Newsletter<br><br>"I have long known Norval Morris to be a talent at the law. It is a discovery to find him such a talent at fiction. His parables are both enchanting and enlightening. What a novel way to make us think about some of the most troublesome issues of crime and punishment!"--Daniel Schorr, Senior<br>News Analyst, National Public Radio<br><br>"Morris's parables place him in that small company of law teachers who, understanding the enlightening potential of stories, are twice empowered. They can make sense of issues of law and justice for lay readers. And, they rescue law students from drowning in sterile appellate cases by<br>reassuring them that law is, indeed, about life."--Derrick Bell, New York University School of Law<br><br>"This excellent work of imaginative sympathy reconstructs Orwell's life as a Burmese policeman and magistrate, treating his moral dilemmas as a filter through which to pose questions of justice both universal and urgently contemporary....Morris raises powerful issues of legal ethics and even<br>fills in some of the missing chapters of young Eric Blair's five years in Burma. The Brothel Boy should interest those who want to find out more about the relationship between legal reasoning and cultural values."--John Rodden, author of The Politics of Literary Reputation</p><h2>Migrating to the Movies: Cinema and Black Urban Modernity</h2><p>The rise of cinema as the predominant American entertainment around the turn of the last century coincided with the migration of hundreds of thousands of African Americans from the South to the urban "land of hope" in the North. This richly illustrated book, discussing many early films and illuminating black urban life in this period, is the first detailed look at the numerous early relationships between African Americans and cinema. It investigates African American migrations onto the screen, into the audience, and behind the camera, showing that African American urban populations and cinema shaped each other in powerful ways. <br><br>Focusing on Black film culture in Chicago during the silent era, <i>Migrating to the Movies </i>begins with the earliest cinematic representations of African Americans and concludes with the silent films of Oscar Micheaux and other early "race films" made for Black audiences, discussing some of the extraordinary ways in which African Americans staked their claim in cinema's development as an art and a cultural institution.</p><p>"With this book, Stewart establishes herself as the authority on early Black cinema. The historiography is meticulous, original and compelling. Stewart puts theory and history into productive conversation. An extremely important work."&#x2015;Linda Williams, author of <i>Playing the Race Card</i><br><br>"As a child in West Virginia, I loved the movies, but I had little idea that my people's history was being constructed (and deconstructed) as I watched them. Jacqueline Najuma Stewart's bold new book lets us see how black history was, in part, made at the movies. The history of the Great Migration has rarely been so vivid or compelling."&#x2015;Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author of <i>America Behind the Color Line: Dialogues with African Americans</i><br><br>"Jacqueline Stewart's <i>Migrating to the Movies</i> finally brings the unmistakable sparkle of brilliance to the field of racial constructions in early cinema. Part of Stewart's magic in this book is her substantial gift for critical insight, while the other part of this inimitable brew is her uncanny grasp of this particular topic. As an avid student of silent film for the past decade, I've been patiently waiting for a work that would juggle the obvious sociological weight of the raw material while also grappling with the technological and aesthetic complexities at stake. <i>Migrating to the Movies</i> is the first book to achieve this, and it is an indispensable volume on racial constructions of vision and the scopic gaze in the early twentieth century."&#x2015;Michele Wallace, author of <i>Dark Designs and Visual Culture</i>&#34;With this book, Stewart establishes herself as the authority on early Black cinema.

Though Weyl was not primarily a philosopher, his wide-ranging philosophical reflections on the formal and empirical sciences remain extremely valuable. Besides indicating clearly which results of classical analysis are invalidated by an important family of "non-circular" (predicative) theories, <i>The Continuum </i>wrestles with the problem of applying constructive mathematical models to cases of concrete physical and perceptual continuity. This new English edition features a personal reminiscence of Weyl written by John Archibald Wheeler.<br>Originally published in German in 1918, the book consists of two chapters. Chapter One, entitled Set and Function, deals with property, relation and existence, the principles of the combination of judgments, logical inference, natural numbers, iteration of the mathematical process, and other topics. The main ideas are developed in this chapter in such a way that it forms a self-contained whole.<br>In Chapter Two, The Concept of Numbers &amp; The Continuum, Weyl systematically begins the construction of analysis and carries through its initial stages, taking up such matters as natural numbers and cardinalities, fractions and rational numbers, real numbers, continuous functions, curves and surfaces, and more.<br>Written with Weyl's characteristic passion, lucidity, and wisdom, this advanced-level volume is a mathematical and philosophical landmark that will be welcomed by mathematicians, physicists, philosophers, and anyone interested in foundational analysis.</p><p>Along with his fundamental contributions to most branches of mathematics, Hermann Weyl (1885&#x2013;1955) took a serious interest in theoretical physics. In addition to teaching in Z�rich, G�ttingen, and Princeton, Weyl worked with Einstein on relativity theory at the Institute for Advanced Studies. <p><b>Hermann Weyl: The Search for Beautiful Truths <br></b>One of the most influential mathematicians of the twentieth century, Hermann Weyl (1885&#x2013;1955) was associated with three major institutions during his working years: the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), the University of Gottingen, and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In the last decade of Weyl's life (he died in Princeton in 1955), Dover reprinted two of his major works, <i>The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics</i> and <i>Space, Time, Matter</i>.

Robert Chazan argues that, while Jewish life in medieval Western Christendom was indeed beset with grave difficulties, it was nevertheless an environment rich in opportunities; the Jews of medieval Europe overcame obstacles, grew in number, explored innovative economic options, and fashioned enduring new forms of Jewish living. His research also provides a reconsideration of the legacy of medieval Jewish life, which is often depicted as equally destructive and projected as the underpinning of the twentieth-century catastrophes of antisemitism and the Holocaust. Dr. Chazan&#39;s research proves that, although Jewish life in the medieval West laid the foundation for much Jewish suffering in the post-medieval world, it also stimulated considerable Jewish ingenuity, which lies at the root of impressive Jewish successes in the modern West.</p><p>This book reevaluates the prevailing notion that Jewish life in medieval Christian Europe was characterized by unremitting restriction and suffering. The Jews of medieval Europe overcame obstacles, grew in number, explored innovative economic options, and fashioned enduring new forms of Jewish living, laying the foundation for impressive Jewish successes in the modern world.Robert Chazan is S. H. and Helen R. Scheuer Professor of Jewish History in the Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University.

All these everyday phrases owe their popularity to the King James Bible. Indeed, it is said that this astonishing Bible has contributed more to the color and grace of the English language than almost any other literary source.<br><br>In <em>Begat</em>, best-selling language expert David Crystal offers a stimulating tour of the verbal richness and incredible reach of the King James Bible. How can a work published in 1611 have had such a lasting influence on the language? To answer this question, Crystal offers fascinating discussions of phrases such as "The skin of one's teeth" or "Out of the mouth of babes," tracing how these memorable lines have found independent life in the work of poets, playwrights, novelists, politicians, and journalists, and how more recently they have been taken up with enthusiasm by advertisers, Hollywood, and hip-hop. He shows, for instance, how "Let there be light" has resurfaced as "Let there be lite," the title of a diet cookbook, and "Let there be flight," the title of an article about airport delays. Along the way, Crystal reminds us that the King James Bible owes much to earlier translations, notably those by Wycliffe in the fourteenth century and Tyndale in the sixteenth. But he also underscores crucial revisions made by King James's team of translators, contrasting the memorable "Am I my brother's keeper" with Wycliffe's "Am I the keeper of my brother." <br><br>Language lovers and students of the Bible will be equally enthralled by <em>Begat</em> and its engaging look at the intersection of religion and literature.<br></p><p><br><strong>David Crystal</strong> is the foremost writer and lecturer on the English language, with a worldwide reputation and over 100 books to his credit. He is Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor, and was awarded the OBE for services to the English Language. His books include <em>The</em> <em>Stories of English, The Fight for English, Words, Words, Words</em>, and many more.<br>Next year marks the 400th anniversary of the publication of the King James Version of the Bible. Begat joins the volumes that draw attention to the unparalleled influence of the KJV on English language and literature. Crystal, an honorary professor of linguistics at the University of Wales, Bangor, U.K. and the author of several books including The Fight for English, undertook to search the entire KJV for every idiom (as distinct from quotations) that has become part of modern English vernacular. This book is the result of that quest. With a brief introduction and an epilogue that specifically answers the quantitative question, "How many did he find?" (answer: 257), the bulk of the book is devoted to the individual expressions and how they appear in modern popular culture. This makes for the kind of eclectic yet entertaining reading that one might tuck into a bathroom book basket. Readers can dip into the book anywhere and discover humorous and bizarre uses of biblical idioms alongside predictably sober and pious usages. An index of expressions directs readers to relevant pages. (Dec.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Ren� Magritte&#39;s famous canvas provides the starting point for a delightful homage by French philosopher and historian Michel Foucault. Much better known for his incisive and mordant explorations of power and social exclusion, Foucault here assumes a more playful stance. By exploring the nuances and ambiguities of Magritte&#39;s visual critique of language, he finds the painter less removed than previously thought from the pioneers of modern abstraction.</p><p>One of the most important theorists of the twentieth century, <b>Michel Foucault's </b>(1926-1984) many influential books include <i>Discipline and Punish, The Archeology of Knowledge, The History of Sexuality, </i>and <i>The Discourse on Language. </i>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volume I: The Complete Text</h2><p><p><i>The Old Regime and the Revolution</i> is Alexis de Tocqueville's great meditation on the origins and meanings of the French Revolution. One of the most profound and influential studies of this pivotal event, it remains a relevant and stimulating discussion of the problem of preserving individual and political freedom in the modern world. Alan Kahan's translation provides a faithful, readable rendering of Tocqueville's last masterpiece, and includes notes and variants which reveal Tocqueville's sources and include excerpts from his drafts and revisions. The introduction by France's most eminent scholars of Tocqueville and the French Revolution, Fran�oise M�lonio and the late Fran�ois Furet, provides a brilliant analysis of the work.</p></p><p>One is sorely tempted to allow the marvelously lucid prose in Alan S. Kahan's new translation of Alexis de Tocqueville's study of the French Revolution speak for itself: "In 1789 the French made the greatest effort ever undertaken by any people to disassociate themselves from their past, and to put an abyss between what they had been and what they wished to become." But as Tocqueville found out when--with the hindsight of half a century--he examined the historical records, the revolution was really not so radical a turn of events. "True, it took the world by surprise, and yet it was the result of a very long process, the sudden and violent climax of a task to which ten generations had contributed." Thus the first volume of <i>The Old Regime and the Revolution</i> concerns itself with the state of affairs before 1798, getting beyond the "confused and often mistaken notions" of his contemporaries "about the manner in which business was conducted, the real practices of institutions ... the real basis of ideas and mores." Although many historians have taken on the French Revolution in the years since Tocqueville's analysis was first published, few have addressed the subject with as effective a combination of insight and clarity. <i>--Ron Hogan</i><b>Alan S.

Whether the conversion is from one religious tradition to another, from one denomination to another, from no involvement to participation in a religious community, or is an intensification of commitment within one's faith, the process can be complex but compelling and transformative.<br><br>In this book Lewis Rambo discusses the dynamics of conversion, presenting it as a multifaceted process of change with personal, cultural, social, and religious implications. Drawing on insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, theology, and missiology, as well as on interviews with converts from disparate backgrounds, Rambo explores the forces that shape the conversion experience. He considers various theories of conversion, examines the role of cultural and social factors in the conversion process, and describes how different religions and disciplines view conversion. While acknowledging the individual nature of each conversion experience, Rambo discerns stages that are illuminating. These include opening oneself to new options; seeking a resolution to the dilemma or deprivation that makes change seem attractive; meeting the agent who embodies the religious vision; learning new roles, rituals, and rhetoric; and committing oneself to a new way of life. His book will not only encourage empathy for the converting process but will also provide a nuanced strategy of critique and evaluation of religious conversion throughout the world.</p><p><b>Lewis R.

The middle section tackles the challenge of transforming huge piles of text, audio, and visual information into<br>an ethnographic whole through generic and specific coding and quantification of qualitative data, using multiple extended examples. Chapters show how to use computers in analysis of qualitative data and ways to integrate the results of quantitative and qualitative data into a comprehensive picture of a complex whole. Chapter 9 presents a rare and comprehensive description of the statistics<br>regularly used by ethnographers to analyze ethnographic surveys. Chapters 10 and 11 show how researchers create and then fine-tune preliminary results into an integrated whole, display them for multiple audiences, and write them up.

It suggests multiple evaluation approaches and insights that can be used to change the difficult to the possible and eventually to the probable. While many chapters underscore the use of traditional evaluation approaches, other chapters operationalize vocational assessment as an individualized, creative, empowering, holistic process and experience of self-discovery. This edition&#x2019;s 15 chapters incorporate these issues, provide updated, expanded and new material, and emphasize that the process of evaluation should identify the consumer&#x2019;s career-related strengths and potential to acquire specific skills. A new chapter focuses exclusively on the transition-age student, a topic receiving increased attention in vocational rehabilitation.

Mitchell Duneier, a sociologist, spent four years at the Valois writing this moving profile of the black men who congregate at "Slim's Table." Praised as "a marvelous study of those who should not be forgotten" by the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i><i>Slim's Table</i> helps demolish the narrow sociological picture of black men and simple media-reinforced stereotypes. In between is a "respectable" citizenry, too often ignored and little understood.<br> <br> "<i>Slim's Table</i> is an astonishment. Duneier manages to fling open windows of perception into what it means to be working-class black, how a caring community can proceed from the most ordinary transactions, all the while smashing media-induced stereotypes of the races and race relations."&#x2014;Citation for <i>Chicago Sun Times</i> Chicago Book of the Year Award<br> <br> "An instant classic of ethnography that will provoke debate and provide insight for years to come."&#x2014;Michael Eric Dyson, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br> <br> "Mr. Duneier sees the subjects of his study as people and he sees the scale of their lives as fully human, rather than as diminished versions of grander lives lived elsewhere by people of another color. . . . A welcome antidote to trends in both journalism and sociology."&#x2014;Roger Wilkins, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><p>At the Valois &#34;See Your Food&#34; cafeteria on Chicago&#39;s South Side, black and white men gather around formica tables finding companionship over hot coffee and steam-table food. Mitchell Duneier spent four years at Valois writing this moving profile of the black men who congregate at &#34;Slim&#39;s table&#34;. They take center stage in stories that illuminate a new image of black masculinity and respectability. Duneier introduces us to Slim, a car mechanic living in the ghetto, who shows his concern for Bart, a prejudiced white senior citizen. In this story of black masculinity and the possibilities of racial integration, Slim treats Bart with care and affection, which moves the old man to the limits of his own potential for tolerance and respect. We meet at Valois a group of men who are firm, resolute, sincere, and sensitive. There is Ted, retired from the army and working in a photo lab, whose pronouncements about American society and politics illustrate the standard of respectability in black America. And Jackson, a semi-retired crane operator and longshoreman who lives in a ramshackle apartment without a telephone. In his old age, he struggles lifting boxes at the docks to pay off overwhelming medical bills. Slim&#39;s Table helps demolish the narrow sociological picture of black men and the simple, media-reinforced stereotypes which restrict blacks to one of two groups - the ghetto underclass and the so-called middle-class role models. In between is a &#34;respectable&#34; citizenry, too often ignored and little understood. Duneier demonstrates that a proper understanding of the men at Slim&#39;s table calls into question fundamental assumptions that have long dominated discussions of urban poverty. This leadshim to fashion a new way of looking at role models and at the exodus of the black middle class from the inner city. In a pioneering, revisionist analysis of many classic works in black studies, he also argues that some of the most &#34;enlightened&#34; books ultimately confirm the basest stereotypes. We see the men at Slim&#39;s table living with pride and principle, respect for age and wisdom, and devotion to civility. They are a model, not only for other blacks, but for middle-class white manhood as well. They act and speak candidly in an impassioned book that has the power to change the way we talk to and think about one another, across the racial divide.Mitchell Duneier is an award-winning urban ethnographer at Princeton University and the City University of New York Graduate Center. He is most famous for his book Sidewalk, which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. Duneier&#39;s research focuses on the urban poor and other groups in the margins of society.</p><h2>101 Things I Wish I&#39;d Known When I Started Using Hypnosis</h2><p>For the past thirty years, Dabney Ewin has been teaching medical hypnosis at Tulane University. In all that time, he has dealt with hundreds of patients but the one thing that stands out during this illustrious career is that he has never stopped learning something new.<p> This succinct volume is a testament to all the ideas that Dr. Ewin wished he had known about when he first started practicing hypnosis. The words and phrases presented here are designed to give any beginning or experienced student a foundation about the working of hypnosis--this foundation of knowledge Dr. Ewin built up in his more than thirty years of practice. Dr. Ewin 'believes his patients can get well, because they do.' With his words, images and suggestions, noted throughout this little book of wisdom, he understands that the mind can change the way the brain functions and conversely, he also knows the brain can change the way the mind functions. In hypnosis, he makes this healing resonance between mind and body happen again and again. Simply put, his patients become whole again.</p></p><p><b>Dabney Ewin, MD,FACS</b>, is a Clinical Professor of Surgery &amp; Psychiatry at Tulane University Medical School in New Orleans, Louisiana.

The letter probes into the one of most profound questions of faith: If it is God's will that believers be crowned with glory and honor, why are the faithful subject to suffering and shame? Through the stories of Abraham and Sarah, Moses, and Rahab, whose faith enabled them to overcome severe trials and conflicts, and through the story of Jesus himself, whose sufferings opened the way to God's presence for all, the sermon confirms the foundations of the Christian faith.<br><br>In a magisterial introduction, Koester presents a compelling portrait of the early Christian community and examines the debates that have surrounded Epistle to the Hebrews for two millennia. Drawing on his knowledge of classical rhetoric, he clarifies the book's arguments and discusses the use of evocative language and imagery to appeal to its audience's minds, emotions, and will. Providing an authoritative, accessible discussion of the book's high priestly Christology, this landmark commentary charts new directions for the interpretation of Epistle to the Hebrews and its influence on Christian theology and worship.</p></p><p>Craig R.

Companies must establish a managerial organization structure that puts competent managerial leaders into suitable roles. The aim of this practical text is to provide a foundation for leadership at a down-to-earth and understandable level.</p><p>Jaques and Clement have zeroed in on the most pressing issue of the 21st century, Executive Leadership. <p>In this new book, Elliott Jaques' remarkable microscope, through which we can examine the internal, personal world of human intent and the external social world of work, is made, for the first time, readily accessible to the reader. Just as Galileo allowed us to look at the stars with a new understanding of our physical universe, Elliott Jaques allows us to look at both our individuality and our human inter-actions in the workplace with a new understanding. The totally new social order available through this remarkable lens shows us our world as it really is - not as we have imagined it to be. </p><p>The application of these ideas by Clement and Jaques has had a powerful impact on US Army leadership, training and doctrine. They have now written this very practical book telling you, the accountable manager, how to achieve an organization full of people going along together in the direction you have set.</p>Achieving decisive, accountable, value-adding, managerial leadership is critical to effective organizations. Jaques and Clement approach this leadership question in an entirely new way.<br> <p>By clarifying the meaning of leadership within the organizational structure. they show that all managers must have leadership accountability, and that there con be no such thing as an effective manager who does not effectively discharge that accountability.<br> </p> <p>It is in this analysis of what makes for effective managerial leadership that Executive Leadership is at its most radical. Jaques and Clement reject the notion that particular groups of personality qualities and traits characterize effective leaders and instead focus on the requisite organizational structure for managerial leadership to occur.<br> </p> <p><i>Executive Leadership</i> is a refreshingly practical approach to the development of decisive managerial leaders at all levels of the organization. It is essential reading for all concerned with organization development, leadership and human resource management.</p></p><h2>Langford&#39;s Basic Photography: The Guide for Serious Photographers</h2><p><p>This seminal photography text, now in its 10th edition and celebrating its 50th anniversary, has been revamped, reorganized, and modernized to include the most up-to-date, need to know information for photographers.

From Native American sites in New Mexico and Arizona, and the ancient earthworks of the Mississippi Valley, to the most fashionable contemporary buildings of Chicago and New York, the United States boasts three thousand years of architectural history. It is characterized by the diversity of its builders and consumers who include Native American men and women, African, Asian, and European immigrants, as well as renowned professional architects and urban planners.<br> Leading historian Dell Upton's revolutionizing interpretation examines American architecture in relation to five themes: community, nature, technology, money, and art. In giving particular attention to indigenous, folk, ethnic, and popular architectures like Chaco Canyon, the Brooklyn Bridge, and Native American houses, as well as to the great monuments of traditional histories such as Jefferson's Monticello and Wright's Fallingwater, <em>Architecture in the United States</em> reveals the dazzling richness of America's human landscape.<br></p><p><br><strong>Dell Upton</strong> is Professor of Architectural History at the University of California, Berkeley.<br>Upton has attempted a historical survey that includes contributions by all parts of the United States population. Ancient works of Native Americans and by America's numerous "minority" immigrants are interwoven with the Eurocentric canon with which we are most familiar. Upton resists a chronological presentation of these diverse works, choosing instead to present them through common "themes": community, nature, technology, money and art. Spare on the meaning of visual and physical effects created by architecture, his analyses concentrate on social divisions implied and created by the works. Upton shows, quite convincingly, how most of the American canon is derived from a pastiche of imported images, and gives some considerable insight into the effects of these imports. Jefferson's Monticello, often seen as the first masterwork of American architecture, is derived from various published images of European villas, with a plan that sought to reinforce a lord-servant relationship between Jefferson and his many employees. Major monuments, such as the Nebraska State Capitol, and recent urban projects, such as Florida's Seaside, are similarly deconstructed to show the exclusionary ideology behind their designs. While there are plenty of quick and not terribly helpful laments for the excluded peoples of this country, Upton shows, concrete piece by concrete piece, the complex influences on this country's built environment.

This new 3rd edition of <i>Choosing and Using Statistics</i> is a must for all students who use a computer package to apply statistics in practical and project work. <p>Features new to this edition:</p> <ul> <li>Now features information on using the popular free program, R</li> <li>Uses a simple key and flow chart to help you choose the right statistical test</li> <li>Aimed at students using statistics for projects and in practical classes</li> <li>Includes an extensive glossary and key to symbols to explain any statistical jargon</li> <li>No previous knowledge of statistics is assumed</li> </ul></p><p>The first edition of excellent handbook was extremely well received by both students and lecturers alike. It has helped to simplify the often complex and difficult task of choosing and using the right statistics package.This is a book for any student or professional biologist who wants to process data using a statistical package on the computer, to select appropriate methods, and extract the important information from the often confusing output that is produced. It is aimed primarily at undergraduates and masters students in the biological sciences who have to apply statistics in practical classes and projects. Such users of statistics do not have to understand either how tests work or how to do the calculations, and these aspects are not covered in the book.The new edition has been updated to cover the very latest versions of the computer packages described, expanded to include coverage for logistic regression, a more detailed consideration of multivariate analysis, data exploration and further examples of Principle Component Analysis and Discriminate Function Analysis are given.<b>Calvin Dytham</b> has a wide range of research interests in ecology and evolutionary biology and is especially interested in the impacts of dispersal and the arrangement of individuals in space on ecological and evolutionary processes.

In the process, the authors expand readers' understanding of the compatibility between religion and science. Readers will learn that they need not choose religion over science or faith over reason, and that evolution does not threaten but rather enrichs faith. <br><br>The authors make it clear to readers that regardless of what religious or non-religious background they come from--regardless of their religious knowledge and experiences--they can discover that science and religion are not enemies, but are companions in the search for truth. The fresh and fascinating Genesis, Evolution and the Search for a Reasoned Faith explores both the nature of science and religion and the intelligent and intimate conversation that is necessary in the search for truth.</p><p>In the indispensable Genesis, Evolution, and the Search for a Reasoned Faith, four scholars engage in respectful and reasonable dialogue about the relationship between science and religion. Using as their starting point the ongoing--and often heated--discussion regarding evolutionary theory and the biblical accounts of creation, these scholars, from the academic disciplines of biblical studies, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and systematic theology, present an integrated analysis demonstrating the intimate and not antagonistic relationship of their respective disciplines. Readers will encounter a rich and complex exploration of the history and meaning of the biblical creation accounts, the nature of scientific investigation, the ethical and philosophical significance of the theory of evolution, and the need for a theology that embraces evolution, which deepens and broadens faith.<br>Reaching out to undergraduate students of all backgrounds, Genesis, Evolution, and the Search for a Reasoned Faith invites readers to discover a common ground where religion and science join in their pursuit of truth.<br><br>Mary Kate Birge (Biblical Scholar)<br>Ryan Taylor (Biologist)<br>Brian G.

It explains why the brain is put together as it is by describing basic functions and key aspects of its evolution and development. This approach makes the structure of the brain and spinal cord more comprehensible as well as more interesting and memorable. The book offers a detailed outline of the neuroanatomy of vertebrates, especially mammals, that equips students for further explorations of the field.</p><p>Gaining familiarity with neuroanatomy requires multiple exposures to the material with many incremental additions and reviews. Thus the early chapters of this book tell the story of the brain's origins in a first run-through of the entire system; this is followed by other such surveys in succeeding chapters, each from a different angle. The book proceeds from basic aspects of nerve cells and their physiology to the evolutionary beginnings of the nervous system to differentiation and development, motor and sensory systems, and the structure and function of the main parts of the brain. Along the way, it makes enlightening connections to evolutionary history and individual development. <i>Brain Structure and Its Origins </i>can be used for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate classes in neuroscience, biology, psychology, and related fields, or as a reference for researchers and others who want to know more about the brain.</p></p><p>Gerald E.

Lutherans and Presbyterians, Quakers, Catholics, and Covenentors, the Irish, the German, the French, the Welsh&#x2015;groups that rarely intermingled in Europe&#x2015;were thrown together when they confronted the American countryside. Rather than embracing the inescapable and ever-increasing diversity, the European settler communities had their very existence threatened by the tensions and fears among their own groups. Only through "Indian-hating"&#x2015;in both military and rhetorical forms&#x2015;could the splintered colonists find a common ground.In potent, graceful prose that sensitively unearths the social complexity and tangled history of colonial relations, Peter Silver gives us an astonishingly vivid picture of eighteenth-century America. He straddles cultural history, political history, social history, and ethnohistory to offer groundbreaking insights into the seminal forces that continue to shape the United States today. 15 illustrations</p><p>Peter Silver is an assistant professor of history at Princeton University. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.The mid-Atlantic colonies of 18th-century America were home to a remarkable diversity of immigrants&#x2014;Germans, Quakers, Moravians, Englishmen and French, among others. In this exhaustively researched and elegantly written study, Princeton historian Silver asks how all the Europeans lived side by side. The answer, Silver says, is that they were solidified into a single people during the Seven Years' War in the 1750s by the fear of Indian attack. The motley Europeans morphed into white people, defined in opposition to Indians. (An intriguing appendix reveals that colonial newspapers tended to use the adjective white to describe people principally during bouts of Indian war.) But not everyone with pale skin became part of this new people&#x2014;the most fascinating sections of the book explore why some European settlers, such as Quakers (who were accused of betraying white people's interests), were excluded from the collective. Silver also shows how fears of Indian menace were taken up during the Revolution: patriots shored up a distinctive American identity and claimed that the British were engaging in Indian-like atrocities, such as scalping and cannibalism. Silver's study will change the way scholars think about whiteness and will reshape our understanding of how 13 distinct colonies were knit together into one nation. 13 illus., 2 maps. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This book, spanning the first fifty-two years of Mack&#x2019;s life, through 1914, covers his experiences as player, manager, and club owner and will stand as the definitive biography of baseball&#x2019;s most legendary and beloved figure.&nbsp; &nbsp;Norman L. Macht chronicles Mack&#x2019;s little-known beginnings. He tells how Mack, a school dropout at fourteen, created strategies for winning baseball and principles for managing men long before there were notions of defining such subjects. And he details how Mack, a key figure in the launching of the American League in 1901, won six of the league&#x2019;s first fourteen pennants while serving as manager, treasurer, general manager, traveling secretary, and public relations and scouting director (all at the same time) for the Philadelphia Athletics.&nbsp;This book brings to life the unruly origins of baseball as a sport and a business. It also provides the first complete and accurate picture of a character who was larger than life and yet little known: the tricky, rule-bending catcher; the peppery field leader and fan favorite; the hot-tempered young manager. Illustrated with family photographs never before published, it affords unique insight into a colorful personality who helped shape baseball as we know it today.</p><p>Norman L.

I was standing in some kind of beautiful cave, with shimmering walls like white fabric, lit from outside. The angels were all peering down at me, floating in the air. Only one came close, so luminous and white. I don&#x2019;t know how, but I knew it was a she. Light flowed from her. She was very blurry, not at all human-looking. There were huge dark eyes, and a kind of mane made of light, and when she spoke, I couldn&#x2019;t see a mouth moving, but I felt her words, like a breeze against my face, and I understood her completely.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve come because of the baby,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve come to help.&#x201d;</p><h2>Gunnerkrigg Court Vol. 6 (6)</h2><p>It&#x2019;s time to return to Gunnerkrigg Court &#x2013; everyone&#x2019;s favorite school for the supernatural &#x2013; for a not-so-happy reunion between Annie and Kat that will force them both to question everything they thought they knew!<br><br>It's a new year and Annie is settling into her job as the forest medium, while Kat continues her work with the robots.

In a forceful combination of theory and reading, Boyarin raises profound questions concerning the interplay between history, ideology, and interpretation. </p></p><p></p><h2>Interpreting the Times</h2><p>Have you ever noticed how often we use the word &#x201c;time&#x201d; in our everyday conversations? Not only are we acutely aware of the passage of time, but our speech is also littered with references to it: We kill and waste time. Time flies, or sometimes it crawls. We refer to time in countless expressions and figures of speech. Chuck Pierce tackles the subject of time specifically as it relates to God and our relationship with Him, addressing some transcendental questions such as, how can we tell when we get &#x201c;out-of-step&#x201d; with God&#x2019;s timing? Pierce moves readers from viewing time as a philosophy or a curse to seeing it as a real gift from God, presenting a new reality of space, time, spirit and truth as they advance through the pages. This book is for everyone who wants to take back their life, take their place above the linear timeline, and learn to live on earth influenced and empowered by an eternal God.</p><p>View Your Life From God's Perspective What does it look like when a God, who transcends time, steps into our lives to connect with us? When we mess up, can He make us capable of getting back our wasted time? Can He extend our horizon line and give us a glimpse of the future? <p>These are just some of the questions that Chuck Pierce addresses in this revolutionary book as he tackles the subject of time, specifically as it relates to God and our relationship with Him. After reading this book, you will: </p><p>* Learn a new system of understanding time--the way God sees it <br>* Learn to identify where you are out of step with God's timing and how to get back in step <br>* Understand spiritual warfare in a new way--as it relates to time </p><p>One of the leading prophetic voices of today, Pierce helps us understand how God, who lives beyond the restraints of time as we know it, intersects with our lives and gives us revelation and understanding, enabling us to take our place above the linear timeline and see our lives from God's perspective.</p><p>Dr. Charles D. &#x201c;Chuck&#x201d; Pierce serves as Vice President of Global Harvest Ministries in Colorado Springs, Colorado and as President of Glory of Zion International Ministries in Denton, Texas.

I found this idea really weird. As far as I'm concerned, the only competition any writer ought to be interested in is the competition between good writing and bad writing. So, while I get very cross and resentful when a book that I think is terrible does well, I love it when books I think are great do well--I feel that the right side, i.e. good writing, is winning the competition, which I feel benefits me as much as anyone else, because I want to live in a world where brilliant books are valued. Also, if I think a book is better than anything I could write, then I want it to do better than my books in order to reflect that. I suppose what I'm saying is that I want there to be a meritocracy of literature. Would you agree or disagree? </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> I'd definitely love a meritocracy of literature--both for reasons of principle (same as you, I get jumping-up-and-down outraged if I see a good book sidelined in favor of what I consider a crap one) and for very practical reasons. It sort of ties in with why I've never seen you as "the competition." I love what you write. I think it's good. If someone picks up one of your books and reads it and likes it, I think it'll whet their appetite for good books--and, specifically, for good psychological crime. That makes them more likely, not less, to go looking for more and wind up reading something of mine. </p> <p> Sophie, is there anything you wouldn&#x2019;t write about for ethical reasons? I think mystery&#x2019;s one of the most moral genres--it&#x2019;s all about exploring right and wrong, finding truth, achieving justice, how these things are never black and white. We spend a lot of our time thinking about the more dangerous far reaches of morality and immorality. Any ethical lines you wouldn&#x2019;t cross as a writer? </p> <p> <strong>Sophie:</strong> There are no subjects that I think writers shouldn't write about--anything is a valid subject for fiction, and it's possible to handle any subject sensitively or insensitively. I think the ethics are in the way a writer treats a subject, not inherent in the subject itself. Having said that, there are things I don't think I could write about because I find them too horrible--the main one that springs to mind is state-sanctioned execution. If a film or book contains legal execution, I can't watch/read it. I find it too upsetting. The other subject I find too upsetting is fatal illness, especially when the terminally ill person is the loved one of the narrator--so, I guess since I wouldn't read about those things, I wouldn't write about them either! How about you, is there anything you wouldn't write about? </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> The one huge ethical issue, for me, is making sure that I give murder and murder victims the weight they deserve. I don't ever want to write something where the victim is simply a prop that's necessary in order for the story to get under way. Murder, taking another human being's life, is so earth-shatteringly huge: it doesn't just take one life, it affects everyone who comes into contact with it--families, friends, detectives working on the case, people who knew the killer.... I feel like using something so immense as a throwaway plot point would be unethical and cheap. I've got a responsibility to show that immensity, as far as possible. </p> <p> I can't see myself ever writing about child abuse, but that's partly because it became so common in mystery books for a while there--either child abuse was the big secret that was revealed at the end, or else it was the killer's reason/excuse for murder. It got cheap. Apart from that, though, I'm not sure I can see myself avoiding a subject (not permanently, anyway) simply because it wrecks my head too badly. One of the reasons I write crime is in a attempt to understand things that I simply can't get my head around--how one human being can kill another, or deliberately damage another (like the sociopath in one of the books). So I tend to come back to the things that horrify me most, trying to understand them by writing about them. </p> <p> People ask me a lot where I get the ideas for my plots, but someone recently asked me for the first time where I get the ideas for my characters. I thought that was a very cool question, so I&#x2019;m passing it on. Where do yours come from? </p> <p> <strong>Sophie:</strong> I agree with you absolutely about giving the crime the weight it deserves. Which is why I write books that some readers find upsetting. People should be upset about crime! The good thing about crime fiction (usually!) is that it attempts to deal with the worst things that can happen in a way that is uplifting--either because justice is done in the end, or because the light of understanding is shed upon the darkest corners of the human psyche. Even if all you do is understand why a monster behaves monstrously, it helps. I almost think understanding something does more good than fighting against it. </p> <p> To answer your question, my characters come from the plot idea, always. I always start with an intriguing or mysterious situation, and then I work out how that plot starting point could develop. Usually, in order for it to develop as well as it can, it requires a certain kind of character. For example, in my novel <em>The Dead Lie Down</em> (published as <em>The Other Half Lives</em> in the UK), the opening mystery is that a man appears to be confessing to the murder of a woman who isn't dead. His girlfriend, to whom he confesses, knows that this woman isn't dead--and she's the one who keeps pursuing this until she finds out the truth. I needed her, therefore, to be the sort of person who wouldn't say, "Hang on a minute, you're a nutter, I'm off to find a sane boyfriend." So I thought, "What sort of woman would stay with a man she believed to be deluded?" And that was how the character of Ruth, the heroine, came into being--I gave her a past trauma that explained why she would cling to this man that loves her, even though he's driving her crazy and talking apparent nonsense. So I suppose what I'm saying is, plot comes first for me, and character follows shortly afterwards. Which comes first for you? </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> I'm with you on understanding it--I don't think it's possible to fight against evil unless you understand it or at least work to understand it. Otherwise, you're shooting in the dark. There's also the fact that I think the root of all real evil is lack of empathy--the inability to believe at any deep level that other people, people who are different from you, are still real. If I don't accept that people who do evil are real, if I see them as two-dimensional and don't at least accept the possibility of empathizing (not sympathizing, obviously) with their motivations and drives, then I take a step towards evil myself. </p> <p> Plot and character--I work the other way around: I start with the character of the narrator and with a very basic premise, and then I dive in and hope to God there's a plot in there somewhere. With <em>Faithful Place</em> (my third book) I started out with the image of a battered old suitcase I'd seen thrown away outside a Georgian house that was being gutted--it made me start wondering where it had been found, and what if someone had hidden it there and meant to come back for it and never got the chance.... I had that, and the character of Frank Mackey--he showed up in <em>The Likeness</em>, as Cassie's undercover boss, the guy who'll do absolutely anything, to himself or anyone else, to get his man. I started thinking about the two things together--what if it was Frank's first love who had hidden that suitcase, what if they had been about to run away together, what if he always thought she had dumped him, and what if the suitcase resurfaced... </p> <p> <strong>Sophie:</strong> I read a really interesting book recently about human evil. It's called <em>People of the Lie</em>, and it's by M. Scott Peck. Its subtitle is "Towards an Understanding of Human Evil." It's a superb book, and Peck's theory is that evil people are not necessarily those who do great harm, but those who cannot face the reality of their own faults, who have to lie to themselves and pretend they are always good, always in the right--thus making everyone wrong and worse. Peck believes that it's those who constantly lie to themselves about their own undiluted goodness, and sweep all the evidence of their moral flaws under the carpet of their own consciousness, who are truly evil. He sees the lying as a crucial part of the evil. So he would see someone who says, "Yeah, so I killed her? So what?" as less evil than the person who says, "I killed her because she's bad and I'm good, and so it was right to kill her." A lot of "baddies" do harm and don't care--which is obviously terrible, but Peck would say the people who do harm and believe it's good are worse--so people like Hitler, Saddam Hussein. Gordon Brown...just kidding! </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> Ooh. Interesting. The idea that evil isn't only in the action itself, but in the distortion of the surrounding reality, the destruction not just of people but of truth. ("We just sexed up the dossier...") That definitely ties in with mystery writing, where everything spins around the deep human impulse towards truth--the whole arc of the books is the movement towards truth, through various obstacles. </p> <p> <strong>Sophie:</strong> Do you have a favorite of your books, and, if so, is that the same one as the one you think is the best? I can never decide which of mine I like best--I like them all in different ways, and I think they're all best and worst in different ways! </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> I'll probably always have a soft spot for <em>In the Woods</em>, simply because that was the first one and that was the one where, in some ways, I was taking the biggest risk--I put so much time and work and heart into it, I actually turned down acting work to finish it (if you know any actors, you know that turning down work is a HUGE deal, actors are the only people who always want to be working more)--and it was all just on hope, without any reason to think that this book would ever go anywhere except under my bed. I can't be objective enough to have any clue which one's the best, though. I don't think it helps that (maybe because of the different narrators) they're all very different in stuff like pace and tone. Apples and oranges. With the first two, by the time I'd finished all the copy-edits and proof-reads etc, I never wanted to see the bloody book again. That lasted till I saw the advance copies and was so stunned by the fact that this was a real book that I stopped hating the sight of it very fast! With <em>Faithful Place</em>, though, I've finished the proof-reads, haven't seen advance copies yet, and I still don't hate it. I'm hoping this is a good sign. Are there stages in the process when you like/hate yours? </p> <p> <strong>Sophie:</strong> My favorite of yours would have to be <em>In the Woods</em>, but I think the best one is <em>Faithful Place</em>. Which means I should like it best, right? But there was one particular thing in In the Woods that I loved--Rob and Cassie's relationship and the way he ended up behaving. I've never come across such a good analysis in any other book of the way commitment-phobic men behave! I love my books when I have the idea, when I write the first hundred pages, and then again when they're in book form with their nice covers on! I hate them between page 100 and when they're finished--because that's when I'm laboring over them, and wondering whether I can make them fulfill the promise of the initial idea--and the end isn't in sight yet, so I feel weary. How important are titles to you? I can't start writing until I've got the title--it's a central part of the inspiration. My American titles are generally different, but I love them--I love all my titles. I hate thriller titles that just sound generic, like <em>Dead Kill</em> or something like that! </p> <p> <strong>Tana:</strong> My favorite of yours is probably <em>Hurting Distance</em> because I love the fact that it doesn't focus on a murder. When rape comes up in mystery books, it's usually as an adjunct to the "real" crime of murder, rather than being the crime itself. I also think, without giving away too much, the angle on evil in that one is different from anything I've ever seen explored anywhere else. My favorite of your titles is <em>A Room Swept White</em>, though. I'm truly awful at titles--<em>Faithful Place</em> is the only one I came up with myself, I'm not even going to tell you what the first two books were called when they were living on my computer. I hate the generic wordplay-type titles too, but what I come up with if I'm left to my own devices isn't much better. </p> <br><strong>Sophie Hannah</strong> is an award-winning poet and crime fiction writer whose novels are international bestsellers.<br><br><strong>Tana French</strong> is the bestselling author of <em>In the Woods</em>, which won the Edgar, Barry, Macavity, and Anthony awards, and of <em>The Likeness</em>.

Now after over three decades of studying and teaching Isaiah, Alec Motyer presents a wealth of comment and perspective on this book. Although his emphasis is on the grammatical, historical, structural, literary and theological dimensions of the text, Motyer writes with an eye on its meaning for Christians today. Based on the author&#39;s knowledge of the Hebrew text, but utilizing the New International Version, the commentary easily accommodates readers without a working knowledge of biblical Hebrew.Preachers, teachers and serious Bible students of all types will find this commentary a wise, winsome and welcome guide to the prophecy of Isaiah. It may easily be the best one-volume evangelical commentary on Isaiah available today.</p><p></p><h2>The Battle for People&#39;s Park, Berkeley 1969</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Resplendent.... A masterwork of history.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ron Jacobs, <i>Counterpunch</i></b><p>In eyewitness testimonies and hundreds of remarkable photographs,&nbsp;<i>The Battle for People's Park, Berkeley 1969</i>&nbsp;commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of one of the most searing conflicts that closed out the tumultuous 1960s: the Battle for People's Park. In April 1969, a few Berkeley activists planted the first tree on a University of California-owned, abandoned city block on Telegraph Avenue. Hundreds of people from all over the city helped build the park as an expression of a politics of joy. The University was appalled, and warned that unauthorized use of the land would not be tolerated; and on May 15, which would soon be known as Bloody Thursday, a violent struggle erupted, involving thousands of people. Hundreds were arrested, martial law was declared, and the National Guard was ordered by then-Governor Ronald Reagan to crush the uprising and to occupy the entire city. The police fired shotguns against unarmed students. A military helicopter gassed the campus indiscriminately, causing schoolchildren miles away to vomit. One man died from his wounds. Another was blinded. The vicious overreaction by Reagan helped catapult him into national prominence. Fifty years on, the question still lingers: Who owns the Park?</p></p><p>Tom Dalzell is a longtime resident of Berkeley, a union lawyer, a regular contributor to <i>Berkeleyside</i> online newspaper, and the author of the Quirky Berkeley series, published by Heyday.<br><br>Todd Gitlin is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage</i>.

She argues that sexual liberation was much more than a reaction to 1950s repression because it largely involved the mainstreaming of a counterculture already on the rise among girls and young women decades earlier. From World War II&#x2013;era "victory girls" to teen lesbians in the 1940s and 1950s, these nonconforming women and girls navigated and resisted intense social and interpersonal pressures to fit existing mores, using the upheavals of the era to pursue new sexual freedoms.<br><br>Building on a new generation of research on postwar society, Littauer tells the history of diverse young women who stood at the center of major cultural change and helped transform a society bound by conservative sexual morality into one more open to individualism, plurality, and pleasure in modern sexual life.<br><br></p><p>Amanda H.

In this collection of interviews, sociologist Shannon Elizabeth Bell presents the voices of twelve Central Appalachian women, environmental justice activists fighting against mountaintop removal mining and its devastating effects on public health, regional ecology, and community well-being.</p><p>&nbsp;Each woman narrates her own personal story of injustice and tells how that experience led her to activism. The interviews--many of them illustrated by the women's "photostories"--describe obstacles, losses, and tragedies. But they also tell of new communities and personal transformations catalyzed through activism. Bell supplements each narrative with careful notes that aid the reader while amplifying the power and flow of the activists' stories. Bell's analysis outlines the relationship between Appalachian women's activism and the gendered responsibilities they feel within their families and communities. Ultimately, Bell argues that these women draw upon a broader "protector identity" that both encompasses and extends the identity of motherhood that has often been associated with grassroots women's activism. As protectors, the women challenge dominant Appalachian gender expectations and guard not only their families but also their homeplaces, their communities, their heritage, and the endangered mountains that surround them.</p><p>30% of the proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to organizations fighting for environmental justice in Central Appalachia.</p></p><p>Personal stories of women's environmental activism in Central Appalachia<br>Shannon Elizabeth Bell is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky.<br></p><h2>An Unexpected Love (Broadmoor Legacy, Book 2)</h2><p>During a trip to England, Sophie Broadmoor falls head over heels for Wesley Hedrick, a wealthy widower who promises her the world.

A layer of tulle floated over my face, obscuring my view. I shoved it aside to find a tall, bespectacled young man standing behind me. His expression was serious, but there was an unmistakable gleam in his eyes that was distinctly at odds with his clerical garb.<br><br>"Oh! Are you the curate? I know you can't be the vicar. I met him last night at the rehearsal and he's simply ancient. Looks like Methuselah's godfather. You're awfully young to be a priest, aren't you?" I asked, narrowing my eyes at him.<br><br>"But I'm wearing a dog collar. I must be," he protested. "And as I said, if you're running away, you've gone about it quite stupidly."<br><br>"I have not," I returned hotly. "I managed to elude both my mother and my future mother-in-law, and if you think that was easy, I'd like to sell you a bridge in Brooklyn."<br><br>"Brooklyn? Where on earth is that?"<br><br>I rolled my eyes heavenward. "New York. Where I live."<br><br>"You can't be American. You speak properly."<br><br>"My parents are English and I was educated here&#x2014;oh, criminy, I don't have time for this!" I pushed my head out the window, but to my intense irritation, he pulled me back, his large hands gently crushing the puffed sleeves of my gown.<br><br>"You haven't thought this through, have you? You can get out the window easily enough, but what then? You can't exactly hop on the Underground dressed like that. And have you money for a cab?"<br><br>"I&#x2014;" I snapped my mouth shut, thinking furiously. "No, I haven't. I thought I'd just get away first and worry about the rest of it later."<br><br>"As I said, not a very good plan. Where are you bound, anyway?"<br><br>I said nothing. My escape plan was not so much a plan as a desperate flight from the church as soon as I heard the organist warming up the Mendelssohn. I was beginning to see the flaw in that thinking thanks to the helpful curate. "Surely you don't intend to go back to the hotel?" he went on. "All your friends and relations will go there straight away when they realise you've gone missing. And since your stepfather is Reginald Hammond&#x2014;"<br><br>I brandished my bouquet at him, flowers snapping on their slender stems. "Don't finish that sentence, I beg you. I know exactly what will happen if the newspapers get hold of the story. Fine. I need a place to lie low, and I have one, I think, but I will need a ride." I stared him down. "Do you have a motorcar?"<br><br>He looked startled. "Well, yes, but&#x2014;"<br><br>"Excellent. You can drive me."<br><br>"See here, Miss Hammond, I don't usually make a habit of helping runaway brides to abscond. After all, from what I hear Mr. Madderley is a perfectly nice fellow. You might be making a frightful mistake, and how would it look to the bishop if I aided and abetted&#x2014;"<br><br>"Never mind!" I said irritably. I poked my head through the window again, and this time when he retrieved me he was almost smiling, although a slim line of worry still threaded between his brows.<br><br>"All right then, I surrender. Where are you going?"<br><br>I pointed in the direction I thought might be west. "To Devon."<br><br>He raised his brows skyward. "You don't ask for much, do you?"<br><br>"I'll go on my own then," I told him, setting my chin firmly. Exactly how, I had no idea, but I could always think of that later.<br><br>He seemed to be wrestling with something, but a sound at the door decided him. "Time to get on. My motorcar is parked just in the next street. I'll drive you to Devon."<br><br>I gave him what I hoped was a dazzling smile. "Oh, you are a lamb, the absolute bee's knees!"<br><br>"No, I'm not. But we won't quarrel about that now. I locked the door behind me but someone's rattling the knob, and I give them about two minutes before they find the key. Out you go, Miss Hammond."<br><br>Without a further word, he shoved me lightly through the window and I landed in the shrubbery. I smothered a few choice words as I bounced out of his way. He vaulted over the windowsill and landed on his feet&#x2014;quite athletically for a clergyman.<br><br>"That was completely uncalled-for&#x2014;" I began, furiously plucking leaves out of the veil.<br><br>He grabbed my hand and I stopped talking, as surprised by the gesture as by the warmth of his hand.<br><br>"Come along, Miss Hammond. I think I hear your mother," he said.<br><br>I gave a little shriek and began to run. At the last moment, I remembered the bouquet&#x2014;a heavy, spidery affair of lilies and ivy that I detested. I flung it behind us, laughing as I ran.<br><br>"I shouldn't have laughed," I said mournfully. We were in the motorcar&#x2014;a chic little affair painted a startling shade of bright blue&#x2014;and the curate was weaving his way nimbly through the London traffic. He seemed to be listening with only half an ear.<br><br>"What was that?"<br><br>"I said I shouldn't have laughed. I mean, I feel relieved, <em>enormously</em> so, if I'm honest, but then there's Gerald. One does feel badly about Gerald."<br><br>"Why? Will you break his heart?"<br><br>"What an absurd question," I said, shoving aside the veil so I could look the curate fully in the face. "And what a rude one." I lapsed into near-silence, muttering to myself as I unpicked the pins that held the veil in place. "I don't know," I said after a while. "I mean, Gerald is so guarded, so <em>English,</em> it's impossible to tell. He might be gutted. But he might not. He's just such a practical fellow&#x2014;do you understand? Sometimes I had the feeling he had simply ticked me off a list."<br><br>"A list?" The curate dodged the little motorcar around an idling lorry, causing a cart driver to abuse him loudly. He waved a vague apology and motored on. For a curate, he drove with considerable flair.<br><br>"Yes. You know&#x2014;the list of things all proper English gentlemen are expected to do. Go to school, meet a suitable girl, get married, father an heir and a spare, shoot things, die quietly."<br><br>"Sounds rather grim when you put it like that."<br><br>"It is grim, literally so in Gerald's case. He has a shooting lodge in Norfolk called Grimfield. It's the most appalling house I've ever seen, like something out of a Bront� novel. I half expected to find a mad wife locked up in the attic or Heathcliff abusing someone in the stables."<br><br>"Did you?"<br><br>"No, thank heavens. Nothing but furniture in the attic and horses in the stables. Rather disappointingly prosaic, as it happens. But the point is, men like Gerald have their lives already laid out for them in a tidy little pattern. And I'm, well, I'm simply not tidy." I glanced at the interior of the motorcar. Books and discarded wellies fought for space with a spare overcoat and crumpled bits of greaseproof paper&#x2014;the remains of many sandwich suppers, it seemed. "You're untidy too, I'm glad to see. I always think a little disorder means a creative mind. And I have dreams of my own, you know." I paused then hurried on, hoping he wouldn't think to ask what those dreams might be. I couldn't explain them to him; I didn't even understand them myself. "I realised with Gerald, my life would always take second place. I would be his wife, and eventually Viscountess Madderley, and then I would die. In the meantime I would open f�tes and have his children and perhaps hold a memorable dinner party or two, but what else? Nothing. I would have walked into that church today as Penelope Hammond and walked out as the Honourable Mrs. Gerald Mad-derley, and no one would have remembered me except as a footnote in the chronicles of the Madderley family."<br><br>"Quite the existential crisis," he said lightly. I nodded.<br><br>"Precisely. I'm very glad you understand these things." I looked around again. "I don't suppose you have a cigarette lying about anywhere? I'd very much like one."<br><br>He gestured towards the glovebox and I helped myself. As soon as I opened it, an avalanche of business cards, tickets, receipts and even a prayer book fell out. I waved a slip of paper at him. "You haven't paid your garage bill," I told him. "Second notice."<br><br>He smiled and pocketed the paper. "Slipped my mind. I'll take care of it tomorrow."<br><br>I shovelled the rest of the detritus back into the glovebox, and he produced a packet of matches. I pulled out a cigarette and settled back then gave a little shriek of dismay. "Heavens, where are my manners? I forgot to ask if you wanted one."<br><br>He shook his head. "I don't indulge."<br><br>I cocked my head. "But you keep them around?"<br><br>"One never knows when they'll be in demand," he said. "How long have you had the habit?"<br><br>"Oh, I don't. It just seems the sort of thing a runaway bride ought to do. I'll be notorious now, you know."<br><br>I gave the unlit cigarette a sniff. "Heavens, that's foul. I think I shall have to find a different vice." I dropped the cigarette back into the packet.<br><br>He smiled but said nothing and we lapsed into a comfortable silence.<br><br>I studied him&#x2014;from the unlined, rather noble brow to the shabby, oversized suit of clothes with the shiny knees and the unpolished shoes. There was something improbable about him, as if in looking at him one could add two and two and never make four. There was an occasional, just occasional, flash from his dark eyes that put me in mind of a buccaneer. He was broad-shouldered and athletic, but the spectacles and occupation hinted he was bookish.<br><br>There were other contradictions as well, I observed. Being a curate clearly didn't pay well, but the car was mint. Perhaps he came from family money, I surmised. Or perhaps he had a secret gambling habit. I gave him a piercing look. "You don't smoke. Do you have other vices? Secret sins? I adore secrets."<br><br>Another fellow might have taken offence but he merely laughed. "None worth talking about. Besides, we were discussing you. Tell me," he said, smoothly negotiating a roundabout and shooting the motorcar out onto the road towards Devon, "what prompted this examination of your feelings? It couldn't be just the thought of marrying him. You've had months to accustom yourself to the notion of being the future Viscountess Madderley. Why bolt now?"<br><br>I hesitated, feeling my cheeks grow warm. "Well, I might as well tell you. You are a priest, after all. It would be nice to talk about it, and since you're bound by the confessional, it would be perfectly safe to tell you because if you ever tell anyone you'll be damned forever."<br><br>His lips twitched as if he were suppressing a smile. "That isn't exactly how it works, you know."<br><br>I flapped a hand. "Close enough. I always had doubts about Gerald, if I'm honest. Ever since he asked me to dance at the Crichlows' Christmas ball during the little season. He was just so staid, as if someone had washed <em>him</em> in starch rather than his clothes. But there were flashes of something more. Wit or kindness or gentleness, I suppose. Things I thought I could bring out in him." I darted a glance at the curate. "I see now how impossibly stupid that was. You can't change a man. Not unless he wants changing, and what man wants changing? The closer the wedding got, the more nervous I became and I couldn't imagine why I wasn't entirely over the moon about marrying Gerald. And then my aunt sent me a book that made everything so clear."<br><br>"What book?"<br><br>"Mrs. Stopes' book, <em>Married Love"</em><br><br>"Oh, God." He swerved and neatly corrected, but not before I gave him a searching look.<br><br>"I've shocked you." Most people had heard of the book, but few had read it. It had been extensively banned for its forthright language and extremely modern&#x2014;some would say indecent&#x2014;ideas.<br><br>He hurried to reassure me. "No, no. Your aunt shocked me. I wouldn't imagine most ladies would send an affianced bride such a book."<br><br>"My aunt isn't most ladies," I said darkly. "She's my father's sister, and they're all eccentric. They're famous for it, and because they're aristocrats, no one seems to mind. Of course, Mother nearly had an apoplexy when she found the book, but I'd already read it by that point, and I knew what I had to do."<br><br>"And what was that?"<br><br>"I had to seduce Gerald."<br><br>This time the curate clipped the edge of a kerb, bouncing us hard before he recovered himself and steered the motorcar back onto the road.<br><br>"I shocked you again," I said sadly.<br><br>"Not in the slightest," he assured me, his voice slightly strangled. He cleared his throat, adopting a distinctly paternal tone in spite of his youth. "Go on, child."<br><br>"Well, it was rather more difficult to arrange than I'd expected. No one seems to want to leave you alone when you're betrothed, which is rather silly because whatever you get up to can't be all that bad because you're with the person you're going to be getting up to it with once you're married, and it's all right then. And isn't it peculiar that just because a priest says a few words over your head, the thing that was sinful and wrong is suddenly perfectly all right? No offence to present company."<br><br>"None taken. It does indeed give one pause for thought. You were saying?"<br><br>"Oh, the arrangements. Well, I couldn't manage it until a fortnight ago. By that time I was fairly <em>seething</em> with impatience. I'm sorry&#x2014;did you say something?"<br><br>"Not at all. It was the mental image of you seething with impatience. It was rather distracting."<br><br>"Oh, I am sorry. Should we postpone this discussion for another time? When you're not driving perhaps?"<br><br>"No, indeed. I promise you this is the most interesting discussion I've had in a very long while."<br><br>"And you're still not shocked?" I asked him. I was feeling a bit anxious on that point. I had a habit of engaging in what Mother called Inappropriate Conversation. The trouble was, I never realised I was doing it until after the fact. I was always far too busy enjoying myself.<br><br>"Not in the slightest. Continue&#x2014;you were seething."<br><br>"Yes, I was in an absolute fever, I was so anxious. We were invited to the Madderleys' main estate in Kent&#x2014;a sort of 'getting to know you' affair between the Madderleys and the Hammonds. It was very gracious of Gerald's mother to suggest it, although now that I think about it, it wasn't so much about the families getting to know one another as about the viscount and my stepfather discussing the drains and the roofs and how far my dowry would go to repairing it all."<br><br></p><h2>The Ways of Paradox and Other Essays: Revised and Enlarged Edition</h2><p><p>This expanded edition of <i>The Ways of Paradox</i> includes papers that are among Professor W.

He wrote twenty-one books, thirteen of them published by Harvard University Press.&#x201c;[Quine] is at once the most elegant expounder of systematic logic in the older, pre-G�delian style of Frege and Russell, the most distinguished American recruit to logical empiricism, probably the contemporary American philosopher most admired in the profession, and an original philosophical thinker of the first rank... The title essay of Quine&#x2019;s <i>The Ways of Paradox</i> is a beautifully concise survey of the nature and significance of paradoxes... In general Quine&#x2019;s style combines a certain rotundity of utterance with a verbal wit that exploits the submerged associations and resonances of technical terms.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anthony Quinton</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The remarkable feature of this collection of essays is the achievement of profundity without the sacrifice of clarity. More than a clear, concise, nonmathematical presentation of logical perplexities and problems, this work is one written so that any intelligent layman can grasp the ideas wrestled with by Quine and other leading logicians. The manner in which the author interprets the pioneers of logical thought possesses the fascination of an exciting game rather than a dry intellectual exercise.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>William S.

In <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;Culture Of Disbelief</i>, Stephen Carter&nbsp;&nbsp;explains how we can preserve the vital separation of&nbsp;&nbsp;church and state while embracing rather than&nbsp;&nbsp;trivializing the faith of millions of citizens or&nbsp;&nbsp;treating religious believers with disdain. What makes&nbsp;&nbsp;Carter's work so intriguing is that he uses liberal&nbsp;&nbsp;means to arrive at what are often considered&nbsp;&nbsp;conservative ends. Explaining how preserving a special&nbsp;&nbsp;role for religious communities can strengthen our&nbsp;&nbsp;democracy, <i>The Culture Of Disbelief</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;recovers the long tradition of liberal religious&nbsp;&nbsp;witness (for example, the antislavery,&nbsp;&nbsp;antisegregation, and Vietnam-era antiwar movements). Carter&nbsp;&nbsp;argues that the problem with the 1992 Republican&nbsp;&nbsp;convention was not the <i>fact</i> of&nbsp;&nbsp;open religious advocacy, but the <i>political&nbsp;&nbsp;positions</i> being advocated.</p><p>"Rational argument rarely seems as warm, as human, as it does in this book...Carter leads the reader to contemplate the embattled constitutional wall between the state and religion, and he does so without furor, without dogma, with only the qualities he envisions in the ideal public square: moderation, restraint, respect." -- <i>The New Yorker</i>.<b>Stephen L.

Ruby McGavin, grieving over the recent death of her husband, Cole, is shocked to discover that Cole lied to her about his family. They're not all dead, as he told her, but very much alive, and in his will, he has left her his share of the family ranch in California. Ruby heads to tiny Cardinal, Calif., with Cole's ashes, intent on selling her share of the ranch, but she quickly realizes that Cole had hidden many things from her. Cole's younger brother, Lucas, who has fled his life as a lawyer in San Francisco, has returned to Cardinal, where he scrapes out a life as a saddlemaker. Slowly Ruby and Lucas edge closer to the truth of a secret that haunts both their lives. Fowler, with her gift for drawing painfully real and credible characters, takes the reader along on an emotionally powerful ride.

Author Donald Friedman has gathered 400 paintings, drawings, and scultpure--many from private collections, never before published--by more than 200 of the world's most famous writers, including 13 Nobel laureates. <br><br>The result is astounding. Whether viewing the beautiful landscapes that Hermann Hesse credited with saving his life, the manuscript sketches that Fyodor Dostoevsky made of his characters, or the can-can dancers secretly drawn by Joseph Conrad, readers of <i>The Writer's Brush</i> will gain new insights into the lives and minds of their favorite writers and the nature of the creative process itself. <br><br>Accompanying the artwork are fascinating biographies that provide little-known details of the writers' lives in the visual arts and offer the writers' own observations on their art and the relationships they saw between word and image. While written for a broad audience, The Writer's Brush is also an essential reference work, with alphabetical and chronological listings of its subjects and an extensive bibliography. <br><br>As Friedman notes in his introduction, for many of the writers anthologized here, a coin toss could have determined whether to spend the day standing in a smock or seated with a pen. <i>The Writer's Brush</i> brings together for the first time--in one unique, affordable volume--both worlds of these writers in the definitive work of the writer-artist.</p><p>DONALD FRIEDMAN had a successful career as a lawyer before publishing his award-winning first novel, <i>The Hand Before the Eye</i> (Mid-List Press 2000). A lifetime's work, <i>The Writer's Brush</i> represents decades of research by Friedman and includes excerpts from his previously unpublished interviews with such notable writer-artists as Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Wolfe, John Berger, Donald Justice, Lawrence Ferlingetti, and many others. Friedman currently lives in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> In this hefty volume, novelist Friedman takes a look at the artwork of more than 200 authors who found other avenues for expression in drawing, painting or sculpting. Aside from the familiar illustrations of Edward Gorey, Beatrix Potter and (to a lesser extent) Kurt Vonnegut, Friedman also unearths work from literary heavyweights past and present, including the Bronte sisters, Herman Hesse, Rudyard Kipling, Colleen McCullough, Vladamir Nabokov, John Updike and Jonathan Lethem. Each entry offers a short biography and passages from journals, letters or interviews illuminating the author's reasons for picking up pen or paint; according to Elizabeth Bishop, for instance, writers make a "frequent complaint that painting is more fun than writing." Examples of authors' art, one or two from each subject, are handsomely reproduced in vivid color alongside the text. Friedman also covers a long list of writers whose artworks couldn't be located or secured for publication, and essays by William H. Gass and Updike provide perspective. Sure to cover at least a few of any given lit fan's favorites, Friedman's volume provides hours of fascinating browsing, and makes a perfect coffee table book for the avid reader. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Weiner, an expert in constitutional law and legal history, shows us that true individual freedom depends on the existence of a robust state dedicated to the public interest. In the absence of a healthy state, he explains, humans naturally tend to create legal structures centered not on individuals but rather on extended family groups. The modern liberal state makes individualism possible by keeping this powerful drive in check&#x2015;and we ignore the continuing threat to liberal values and institutions at our peril. At the same time, for modern individualism to survive, liberals must also acknowledge the profound social and psychological benefits the rule of the clan provides and recognize the loss humanity sustains in its transition to modernity.</p><p>Masterfully argued and filled with rich historical detail, Weiner's investigation speaks both to modern liberal societies and to developing nations riven by "clannism," including Muslim societies in the wake of the Arab Spring.</p></p><p>Mark S. Weiner teaches constitutional law and legal history at Rutgers School of Law in Newark, New Jersey. He is the author of <i>Black Trials: Citizenship from the Beginnings of Slavery to the End of Caste</i>, which received the Silver Gavel Award of the American Bar Association, and <i>Americans Without Law: The Racial Boundaries of Citizenship</i>, which received the President's Book Award of the Social Science History Association. He lives with his wife in Connecticut.ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>INDIVIDUALISM&#x2019;S PARADOX<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine that one fine morning you are strolling down the sidewalk on your way to work. Suddenly, a young jogger wearing headphones turns the corner, running swiftly, oblivious to the world around him. He crashes into you and as you hit the ground you feel a sharp pain in your arm, which quickly begins to swell. It&#x2019;s broken. Soon after visiting your doctor, you contact your lawyer. He begins a civil suit against the jogger so that you can be compensated for your injury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case is open and shut. The jogger was clearly at fault and he will be held accountable for the harm he caused.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, imagine that you decide to open a small business, perhaps a bakery specializing in German-style breads. You rent the perfect building for the shop and visit your local bank for a loan. The loan officer reviews your excellent business plan and approves it. You sign your name to a stack of papers he slides across his desk and soon you have the capital you need to purchase ovens and other equipment. You are now responsible for repaying the loan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody could seriously question your liability or the bank&#x2019;s right to be repaid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both these cases, the law&#x2019;s basic focus, what social scientists call its framework of analysis or its &#x201c;jural unit,&#x201d; is the individual rather than the family. In the case of the errant jogger, when your lawyer contacts the jogger&#x2019;s lawyer, he will make a claim against the jogger and not against the jogger&#x2019;s brother or sister, who are irrelevant to the suit. Likewise, your own brother or sister will have no claim to any settlement money you might receive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of your business venture, too, much as you might wish to do so, you can&#x2019;t foist your financial obligations onto others without their consent. By taking out a loan, you don&#x2019;t make your family members responsible for the success or failure of your bakery. At the same time, you needn&#x2019;t obtain their permission to take out a loan in the first place. The law makes you responsible for meeting your financial obligations and it also enables you to contract for them yourself, with your own signature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This individualist focus is fundamental to the law of modern liberal societies. It lies at the core of nations that trace their democratic political heritage to the Enlightenment and their economic roots to the Industrial Revolution&#x2014;and that hold individual self-fulfillment and personal development as a central moral value. Indeed, legal individualism is so basic to the social fabric of liberal societies that most of us who live in them take it as a matter of course.1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an election, you cast your vote for yourself alone, rather than for your household, village, or tribe. Doing so would seem absurd&#x2014;it would contravene the axiomatic principle of &#x201c;one person, one vote.&#x201d; Nor does the head of your household, village, or tribe vote on your behalf.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you enter into a marriage, you alone incur its benefits and obligations. A wedding may bind two families together in a metaphorical sense. But it doesn&#x2019;t establish a relationship between them as a matter of law, for instance by requiring them to come to each other&#x2019;s mutual aid or military defense.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If one evening you are watching a movie and a notorious thief, John &#x201c;Quick Hands&#x201d; Smith, steals your car, police will seek to capture and arrest John Smith. If instead the officers arrest his staid brother Jack, an accountant, explaining to a judge that after all Jack is related to John, the officers will be disciplined. Likewise, when you call the police station to report the incident, you will be asked for your street address rather than the name of your grandparents&#x2014;your lineage is irrelevant to whether the state will protect you from crime.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such individualism extends as well to the legal issues of property and inheritance. In liberal societies, land need not be owned in common by tribal groups or village associations, as it is in many parts of the world, with individuals having only a temporary and limited claim to its use, known as a usufruct interest. Instead, land can be held by individuals, who have a general right to do with it as they wish, including the right to exclude others from its benefits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, in common law jurisdictions, people are free to will their estates to whomever they please (civil law jurisdictions impose some limits on this principle). Assuming they comply with technical rules for creating trusts, people may even decide that upon their death their assets will pass to their dogs or cats, as did the flamboyant real estate tycoon Leona Helmsley, who left twelve million dollars in trust for her Maltese dog, Trouble. Whether or not it results in wise or just decisions in any particular case&#x2014;it often quite clearly does not&#x2014;a person&#x2019;s wealth is deemed to be his or her own.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these facts may seem self-evident, perhaps even obvious. But if one looks beneath them, they point to an essential paradox about individual freedom, a paradox that&#x2019;s illuminated by examining the subject of this book: the rule of the clan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#x2019;s a common and understandable belief that liberty exists only when the state is absent or weak. Many people often imply that individual freedom flourishes in inverse proportion to the strength and scope of government. The argument is a perennial feature of American political discourse (&#x201c;freedom means the absence of government coercion,&#x201d; asserts a prominent recent presidential candidate), though it is hardly limited to the United States.2 A deep antipathy to the modern state was a core principle of the United States&#x2019; longtime enemy Col. Muammar al-Qaddafi, who sought, in the words of his manifesto <i>The Green Book</i>, &#x201c;emancipation from the chains of all instruments of government.&#x201d;3 Likewise, guided by a compelling spiritual vision, Mohandas Gandhi advocated for a stateless society of local self-rule for postcolonial India, in which power would be radically decentralized to ancient village communities&#x2014;<i>panchayati raj</i>. He and his followers campaigned for &#x201c;as minimal a &#x2018;state&#x2019; as possible,&#x201d; following the maxim &#x201c;keep government to the minimum, and what you must have, decentralize.&#x201d;4<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, whatever form it takes, the belief that individual freedom exists only when the state is frail misunderstands the source of liberty. The state can be more or less effective in the pursuit of its goals&#x2014;it can be stupid or smart&#x2014;and it can be used for illiberal, totalitarian ends. But ultimately a healthy state dedicated to the public interest makes individual freedom possible.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the paradox of individualism. The individual freedom that citizens of liberal societies rightly cherish, even our very concept of the individual, is impossible without a robust state. Modern individualism depends on the existence of vigorous and effective government dedicated to the public interest, to policies that a majority of citizens would support without regard to their particular position in society at any given moment. It depends as well on the willingness of individual citizens to imagine themselves as members of a common public whose interests the state regularly vindicates.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The state maintains a system of courts to ensure that people play by the rules, rather than resorting to trickery or force to advance their interests. It provides professionally trained police to safeguard people from crime; fire protection to prevent collective disaster; and military power to defend against threats from abroad. It constructs roads and bridges, builds or subsidizes utilities, and supports mass education to encourage economic growth and foster human capital. To mitigate major social and economic risk in advance of calamity, it operates a wide range of regulatory programs, such as those that safeguard the public health or oversee financial instruments, and it provides security for individuals through various forms of welfare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most important, the state stipulates the receipt of these benefits not on a person&#x2019;s membership in an inescapable group but simply on his or her status as an individual.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ability to obtain redress for injury, to enter into contracts on your own terms, to use land and other property, to dispose of your wealth, to be protected from crime, and to access a range of goods and services all depend on the state treating the individual&#x2014;<i>you</i>&#x2014;as a member of a community of legal equals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal status of the individual under a strong liberal state, in which healthy government and robust individualism go hand in hand, might be represented in simple visual form this way: [DIAGRAM] <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a modern liberal society the state, represented by the large circle, is vigorous and effective, clearly demarcating and defining the community it surrounds. The discrete individuals living under the authority of the state, the smaller circles, are in turn equally vital and independent. An essential aim of the liberal legal tradition, as important as its goal of limiting state power&#x2014;though we are often unmindful of its centrality&#x2014;has been to build state capacities to ensure such vitality and independe...</p><h2>Measured Drawings of Shaker Furniture and Woodenware</h2><p><p><strong>Carefully detailed, time-tested guides to building Shaker furniture and woodenware.</strong></p> In harmony with the Shaker spirit, <em>Measured Drawings of Shaker Furniture and Woodenware</em> emphasizes simplicity, precision and utility.

I am nine years old.<br><br>I clutch my little white Bible to my chest and step up on a plastic milk crate. Once again I&#x2019;m ready to prove that I&#x2019;m not ashamed of the gospel. If I can preach on this street corner and withstand the heckling of sinners, I&#x2019;ll show everyone I&#x2019;m ready to be a martyr for the Lord.<br><br>I swallow hard and try to smile. I tell myself that God speaks through the mouths of babies. And I&#x2019;m not a baby. I&#x2019;m nine.<br><br>&#x201c;Praise the Lord!&#x201d; I shout. Nobody looks at me. &#x201c;Praise the Lord !&#x201d; I shout again.<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>This flummoxes me. I&#x2019;ve preached all over the United States with my parents&#x2014;to tourists at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, gay-rights activists in San Francisco, and college students in Midwest university towns&#x2014;but this Rhode Island crowd is the toughest. Maybe Dad is right: maybe the most hardhearted sinners are East Coast Catholic liberals. There is a bookstore nearby, and I redirect my sermon to the Brown<br>University students walking toward it. &#x201c;I want to share with you the glorious message of our Lord Jesus Christ!&#x201d;<br><br>Street-preaching tip: shout the name of Jesus, and people will look at you.<br><br>Suddenly, eyes are on me. I try to smile again&#x2014;&#x201c;Always look pleasant!&#x201d; Mom says&#x2014;but the East Coast humidity sits heavy on my shoulders like a hot, wet blanket. I feel smothered.<br><br>I glance at Dad, and he gives me a boisterous thumbs-up. He says there&#x2019;s no greater honor than being persecuted for my faith. I want somebody to heckle me. Nothing would make my dad happier.<br><br>I open my Bible to the bookmarked spot and hold it open in front of me. I pretend to read the words aloud even though I know them from memory. In my family, preaching is a competitive sport. Before I was reading, I could rattle off the books of the Bible. By age five I could preach a three-point gospel message in one minute. Damnation to salvation in sixty seconds flat.<br><br>&#x201c;In Romans 3:23, the Bible says, &#x2018;For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God&#x2019;!&#x201d; I shout.<br><br>Street-preaching tip: always use the phrase the Bible says to make your words sound as if they come straight from God. And always give &#x2019;em the bad news first, because until sinners understand how wicked they are and how desperately they need Jesus, they won&#x2019;t repent.<br><br>&#x201c;God sent his only begotten Son, Jesus, to die for our sins!&#x201d; I glance at the gathering crowd and decide to ratchet it up a notch. &#x201c;The Bible says it is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgment!&#x201d;<br><br>A plain-faced woman with wiry gray hair is eating ice cream on a nearby street bench. I point my finger at her. &#x201c;You might die today!&#x201d;<br><br>She stops midlick and raises a curious eyebrow at me.<br><br>&#x201c;But there&#x2019;s good news! The Bible says the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>The woman shakes her head and looks away. I direct my last line at a few people standing around. &#x201c;Please ask Jesus into your heart today!&#x201d; I&#x2019;m done. I step off the milk crate and dash to Mom, who is standing nearby holding a stack of Bible study invitations.<br><br>&#x201c;Good job, Elizabeth,&#x201d; Mom says and hands me some invitations.<br><br>&#x201c;Now help me pass these out.&#x201d;<br><br>Whenever we land in a new city to preach the gospel, Dad rents a house near a local university and then draws people to our home Bible study by holding these open-air preaching sessions and community outreaches. Our goal is to plant a new church in six weeks. I turn to hand out the invitations, but someone is yelling.<br><br>&#x201c;Look here, man!&#x201d; a lady shouts. &#x201c;What you&#x2019;re doing to your little girl is wrong!&#x201d;<br><br>I turn to see the wiry-haired ice-cream lady standing in front of Dad, jabbing a finger in his face. &#x201c;This is brainwashing!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whoa, ma&#x2019;am. Please calm down.&#x201d; Dad has his hands up in a gesture of surrender.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me to calm down! You&#x2019;re not in charge of me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, hey. There&#x2019;s no need to yell.&#x201d; Dad chuckles, unruffled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m more than happy to have a conversation with you. Would you like some cookies? Maybe a lemonade?&#x201d; Dad gestures at Mom to serve something from the snacks we&#x2019;ve set up on a card table.<br><br>The angry lady waves her off. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want any of your damned Kool-Aid ! I want you to listen to me for one goddamned minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m afraid we can&#x2019;t have a reasonable conversation if you insist on yelling and using foul language,&#x201d; Dad replies, crossing his arms over his chest. He leans back on his heels and smiles benignly. I clutch Mom&#x2019;s skirt.<br><br>The woman glances at me and then lowers her voice a notch. She leans toward Dad. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she growls, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s fine for you to have your religion. But sticking your little girl up there on a stage and making her yell at people? That&#x2019;s wrong! You&#x2019;re teaching her to manipulate people through fear. You&#x2019;re brainwashing her!&#x201d;<br><br>Dad raises his eyebrows, but his voice remains calm. &#x201c;With all due respect, you don&#x2019;t know me or my daughter. There&#x2019;s no way you can prove what you&#x2019;re saying.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need to prove anything to you!&#x201d; the woman snaps. &#x201c;I know abuse and manipulation when I see it. I should report you to Child Protective Services!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;ve got nothin&#x2019; to hide,&#x201d; Dad says, still smiling. &#x201c;And anyway, I can think of a lot worse things than being brainwashed to love Jesus!&#x201d;<br><br>The lady spins on her heels and stalks away, muttering obscenities.<br><br>&#x201c;May God richly bless ya!&#x201d; Dad calls after her.<br><br>She whips back around, glares at Dad, and then looks directly at me. For one quick second, her face softens. Dad steps forward.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid to think for yourself!&#x201d; she shouts before Dad blocks my view.<br><br>Mom claps her hands over my ears. But it&#x2019;s too late. I already heard it. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to think for yourself.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t even know what that means.<br><br>I was raised in a homegrown, fundamentalist Christian group&#x2014;which is just a shorthand way of saying I&#x2019;m classically trained in apocalypse stockpiling, street preaching, and the King James Version of the Bible.

Selah. I was born in 1977, just a few years after my paternal grandfather, George Geftakys, began holding informal Bible studies in his living room. An insurance salesman and part-time preacher, he had never been officially ordained. He said the only requirement for serving God was &#x201c;hearing the call of Jesus&#x201d; and having the anointing of the Holy Spirit. True disciples of Christ didn&#x2019;t need seminary or the approval of &#x201c;hypocritical, organized religion&#x201d; in order to do the Lord&#x2019;s work. George Geftakys&#x2014;known as Papa George to family&#x2014;claimed his authority came straight from God. Which was just another way of saying he ordained himself. Conveniently, self-ordination also meant Papa George was the final authority on everything and answered to no one. Papa George was pretty much a prophet, priest, and king all rolled into one.<br><br>Still, he found a way to harness the Jesus Movement energy and create his own personal brand of Christianity. Our basic beliefs were similar to Baptists&#x2019; but with Papa George&#x2019;s added emphasis on personal holiness, evangelism, and End of the World prophecy. From our grass-roots start as a Bible study in Papa George&#x2019;s living room, The Assembly&#x2014;as we came to be known&#x2014;grew to include about fifty sister Assemblies throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, and Africa.<br><br>In the beginning, The Assembly was vibrant, energetic, and revolutionary. It was groovy. The social experimentation of the sixties had broken down the walls of tired old religion, and a new generation was falling in love with Jesus. Roaring out of Southern California like wildfire, the Jesus Movement upended traditional Christian denominations and challenged the religious establishment.<br><br>Empty, impersonal ritual was replaced with charismatic, personal experiences. Written prayers gave way to spontaneous individual expression of praise. Preachers like my grandfather insisted traditional churches had become false mediators and God was allowing an outpouring of the Holy Spirit in order to bring people back into direct contact with Jesus. Among those drawn by my grandfather&#x2019;s charisma and Bible preaching was my mother, a beautiful debutante and former high school cheerleader.<br><br>She&#x2019;d grown up in Baptist churches, but as a college freshman, she was looking for something different, something more real. She stumbled across a Bible study being held at California State University, Fullerton, and was immediately dazzled by Papa George&#x2019;s fiery preaching. She also met my dad at that Bible study. He was Papa George&#x2019;s younger son.<br><br>My parents were an unlikely pair. Dad was a college dropout; Mom was a straight-A student. He was gregarious and she was an introvert. Mom told me the first time she saw my dad he was wearing tattered army fatigues, huarache sandals, and&#x2014;here Mom crinkled her nose in disgust&#x2014;&#x201c;he&#x2019;d hitchhiked to the Bible study.&#x201d;<br><br>But they fell in love over studying the Bible, all-night prayer meetings, and living &#x201c;100 percent sold-out for Jesus.&#x201d;<br><br>As Mom liked to say with a nostalgic sigh, &#x201c;In the early days, we didn&#x2019;t have anything but Jesus.&#x201d; Not having anything but Jesus was what everyone always talked about when they reminisced about The Assembly&#x2019;s early years. They fondly remembered being enthusiastic young college students in the early seventies, radically redefining&nbsp; Christianity in a new, exciting way. They saw themselves as faith revolutionaries on the<br>cusp of a huge revival, which would usher in the return of Jesus to Earth. Everyone was finding Jesus and getting saved, baptizing each other in the Pacific Ocean, getting married, and starting families.<br><br>Sometimes, when we were traveling across the United States preaching the gospel, my parents would get all flushed with Jesus fervor, clasp hands, and burst into hymns in two-part harmony. These wild preaching sessions were inevitably followed by noisy lovemaking in whatever cheap hotel room we were renting&#x2014;with me plugging my ears and pretending to be asleep in the other bed.<br><br>It was all very exciting for them, I suppose. But as a child growing up in The Assembly, I had a far different experience.<br><br>As with most revolutions, the idealistic dream that had initially ignited our little band of born-again Christians gradually hardened into a rigid lifestyle. Ironically, by the mideighties, we had morphed to become nearly indistinguishable from the legalistic, organized religion we&#x2019;d rejected in the first place.<br><br>What I remember most are the increasingly strict rules and the insular, fundamentalist traditions we developed. Papa George&#x2019;s interpretation of the Bible was hyperliteral: he demanded complete and total loyalty&#x2014;spiritualizing this conformity as &#x201c;unity in Christ.&#x201d; Children were spanked from six months old until they were teenagers. Women were required to dress very modestly and behave within strict gender roles. Everything, from how we ordered our daily schedules to our tone of voice, was monitored. The only person who wasn&#x2019;t held accountable for anything was Papa George.<br><br>This is why, when people ask me why I call The Assembly a cult, I say it&#x2019;s because we operated like one. Cults aren&#x2019;t so much about beliefs as they are about methods and behavior. According to cult researchers, it is the emotional seizing of people&#x2019;s trust, thoughts, and choices that identifies a cult. The Assembly wins on all counts.<br><br>Fundamentalism that becomes cultish destroys the God-given freedom of each person. Usually this is accomplished through fear. In my own experience, the most detrimental aspect of my childhood was our preoccupation with End of the World theology. Even though my grandfather was never quite certain whether Christians would be persecuted<br>before or after the Rapture, the End of the World was coming soon, and we had to stay prepared.<br><br>Indeed, everything in our lives was oriented toward the End of the World. Thus, my parents never owned a home, never had a savings account, and never invested toward retirement. They didn&#x2019;t save money to send me to college because planning for the future was irrelevant when there was no future. That&#x2019;s why by age nine I had simply resigned myself to dying for Jesus.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s brainwashing?&#x201d; I ask.<br><br>Dad squats in front of me, his face a huge, beaming smile. &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t you worry about that crazy feminist, Wiz,&#x201d; he says, calling me by the nickname he&#x2019;s had for me since I was a toddler. &#x201c;Keep your eye on the prize; you just endured persecution. What a privilege! I bet you just earned yourself a huge crown of glory!&#x201d;<br><br>Mom whispers something in Dad&#x2019;s ear, and he shakes his head. &#x201c;No, no. Don&#x2019;t worry about that,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;If the cops show up, I&#x2019;ll tell them I was exercising my constitutional right to freedom of speech and some crabby feminist didn&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;<br><br>Mom leans against Dad, and he winks at me. &#x201c;Mama, how &#x2019;bout you go get Wiz some frozen lemonade? She&#x2019;s earned it!&#x201d; I feel relief wash over me. I&#x2019;ve preached the gospel and suffered for Jesus. Dad and God are proud of me. If Dad is right about this whole being-persecuted-for-Jesus thing, I&#x2019;ve just scored some major heavenly swag.<br><br>The adults in our fundamentalist church are forever fantasizing about what they&#x2019;ll get in heaven: new bodies, mansions, and crowns of glory. Dad likes to say he wants beachfront property on the Crystal Sea. As Mom walks me to the frozen-lemonade shop, I dream about the heavenly prizes I&#x2019;ve just won. I don&#x2019;t dare say it aloud because Mom will scold me for desiring &#x201c;things of this world,&#x201d; but if I&#x2019;m being honest, all I really want is a television, a Happy Meal, and a Christmas Barbie.</p><h2>Harriman vs. Hill: Wall Street&#x2019;s Great Railroad War</h2><p><p>In 1901, the Northern Pacific was an unlikely prize: a twice-bankrupt construction of the federal government, it was a two-bit railroad (literally&#x2014;five years back, its stock traded for twenty-five cents a share). But it was also a key to connecting eastern markets through Chicago to the rising West. Two titans of American railroads set their sights on it: James J. Hill, head of the Great Northern and largest individual shareholder of the Northern Pacific, and Edward Harriman, head of the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific. The subsequent contest was unprecedented in the history of American enterprise, pitting not only Hill against Harriman but also Big Oil against Big Steel and J. P. Morgan against the Rockefellers, with a supporting cast of enough wealthy investors to fill the ballroom of the Waldorf Astoria. </p><p>The story, told here in full for the first time, transports us to the New York Stock Exchange during the unfolding of the earliest modern-day stock market panic. <i>Harriman vs. Hill </i>re-creates the drama of four tumultuous days in May 1901, when the common stock of the Northern Pacific rocketed from one hundred ten dollars a share to one thousand in a mere seventeen hours of trading&#x2014;the result of an inadvertent &#x201c;corner&#x201d; caused by the opposing forces. Panic followed and then, in short order, a calamity for the &#x201c;shorts,&#x201d; a compromise, the near-collapse of Wall Street brokerages and banks, the most precipitous decline ever in American stock values, and the fastest recovery. Larry Haeg brings to life the ensuing stalemate and truce, which led to the forming of a holding company, briefly the biggest railroad combine in American history, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruling against the deal, launching the reputation of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes as the &#x201c;great dissenter&#x201d; and President Theodore Roosevelt as the &#x201c;trust buster.&#x201d; The forces of competition and combination, unfettered growth, government regulation, and corporate ambition&#x2014;all the elements of American business at its best and worst&#x2014;come into play in the account of this epic battle, whose effects echo through our economy to this day. <br></p></p><p><p>Larry Haeg is former executive vice president of corporate communications for Wells Fargo &amp; Company and a former broadcast journalist.</p><p>"<br>I first read about the Northern Pacific Corner when I was ten years old. When I opened my office on January 1, 1962, I put on the wall a framed copy of the <i>New York Times</i> of May 10, 1901, describing the fateful prior day. Larry Haeg now tells the full story, and I enjoyed every word of it.<br>" &#x2014;Warren Buffett<br></p><br><br>"This book is a page-turner. Even for the reader that knows what is about to happen, Larry Haeg is able to convey a sense of excitement about the events&#x2019; unfolding."&nbsp;&#x2014;H. Roger Grant, author of <i>Railroads and the American People</i><br><br><br>"<i>Harriman vs. Hill</i> is a fascinating read. It treats an important episode in business and financial history, fleshes it out in more detail than any previous author has done, and covers the ground in an engaging style. Haeg&#x2019;s approach is original and clever in the best sense of the word."&nbsp;&#x2014;Maury Klein, author of <i>Union Pacific</i><br></p><h2>Outlaw Cook</h2><p><p>In essays ranging from his earliest cooking lessons in a cold-water walk-up apartment on New York's Lower East Side to opinions both admiring and acerbic on the food writers of the past ten years, John Thorne argues that to eat exactly what you want, you have to make it yourself. Thorne tells us how he learned to cook for himself the foods that he likes best to eat, and following along with him can make you so hungry that his simple, suggestive recipes will inspire you to go into the kitchen and translate your own appetite into your own supper.</p></p><p>&#39;OutlawCook&#39; is an assembly of pieces that for the most part were first published in &#39;Simple Cooking.&#39;<p><b>John Thorne</b> and <b>Matt Lewis Thorne</b> live in Northampton, Massachusetts, where they publish the food letter <i>Simple Cooking. </i>Their book <i>Pot on the Fire</i> won a James Beard Foundation Book Award.</p></p><h2>Opportunity Time</h2><p><p>When newly elected Virginia governor Linwood Holton escorted his children into an integrated Richmond public school in 1970, he delivered the coup-de-grace to the Byrd machine, a network of conservative Democrats who had flouted <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> through their policy of "Massive Resistance" for more than a decade. Opportunity Time is a disarmingly candid memoir that offers a behind-the-scenes account of his private and public life at a critical juncture in the political history of Virginia and the nation.</p><p> Holton&#x2019;s election as the first Republican governor in over one hundred years was the culmination of his efforts to create a two-party democracy in Virginia. His tenure led to the reformation of the structure of Virginia&#x2019;s government and balanced the needs of environmental conservation with the need for the development of key areas, such as Hampton Roads. But his greatest political legacy is his commitment to civil rights, most notably through championing school integration and busing. When Richard Nixon&#x2019;s "Southern Strategy"--aimed at wooing white voters away from the Democratic Party--was in full swing, Holton devised and implemented an alternative southern strategy, one that acknowledged and addressed racial injustice and violence rather than glossing it over or turning a blind eye to it.</p><p> Although a Republican politician, Governor Holton has long held appeal to constituents from both parties. Holton has himself supported moderate Republicans, including Senator John Warner, but as the Republican Party became increasingly conservative, he found his views were more in tune with the state Democratic Party. In recent years, he has endorsed several Democrats for statewide office, including the current governor of Virginia, Holton&#x2019;s son-in-law Tim Kaine.</p><p> Holton&#x2019;s voice in <i>Opportunity Time</i> reflects his small-town roots in Southside Virginia, where his father was a railroad executive, and his direct and pragmatic approach to political issues. This accessible and enjoyable memoir offers an insider&#x2019;s perspective on Republican Party politics and race relations through the eyes of a decent, groundbreaking politician.</p></p><p><p>Linwood Holton served as the governor of Virginia from 1970 to 1974. He is a graduate of Washington &amp; Lee University and Harvard Law School. He served on the Submarine Force in the Navy during World War II. After his governorship, he served as the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations, was the President of the Center for Innovative Technology, and was a member of the Board of Directors for Amtrak. While with the firm of Zuckert, Scoutt and Rasenberger in Washington, D.C., he chaired a commission, initiated by Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole, to privatize ownership of Washington National and Dulles International Airports, which led to the improvement and expansion of each airport. Holton is currently a Director in the Richmond law firm of McCandlish Holton, P.C.</p><p>"Linwood Holton tells why he walked forward with determination at a moment when leadership was needed. His personal story is political memoir at its best: a reaffirmation of idealism recalled with wry humor, a refreshing mix of candor about both himself and others, and a portrait&#x2015;melded with irrepressible optimism and zest for public service&#x2015;of a moment that history shows was, indeed, &#x2018;Opportunity Time.</p> (Ann W. Compton, ABC White House Correspondent)</p><h2>Why We Make Things &amp; Why It Matters</h2><p>Why We Make Things and Why it Matters</p><p>Peter Korn is the founder and Executive Director of the Centre for Furniture Craftmanship, a woodworking and design school in Rockport, Maine. A furniture maker since 1974, his work has been exhibited in galleries and museums across the United States. In addition to writing Why We Make Things and Why It Matters: The Education of a Craftsman, which won the 2014 Maine Literary Award, Korn is the author of several how-to books. These include the bestselling Woodworking Basics: Mastering the Essentials of Craftsmanship and The Woodworker&#39;s Guide to Hand Tools.Drawing on his decades of experience handcrafting fine furniture, Korn&#x2019;s previous books have primarily focused on teaching woodworking to neophytes, including the best-selling Woodworking Basics (2003). In this inspired departure from such how-to guides, Korn explores the fundamental reasons why he and other artistically inclined hobbyists and professionals passionately devote themselves to their craft, often for little recognition or monetary gain. Against the backdrop of a consumer marketplace saturated with machine-manufactured goods, Korn asks readers to consider what makes creative work so rewarding, what the nature of those rewards actually are, and what making things can reveal about our deeper nature. In answering these questions, Korn describes his own life as a crucible of self-discovery, recounting how his middle-class Philadelphia upbringing led to carpentry work, then designing furniture, then teaching woodworking, and finally to founding a furniture-making school in Maine. Written with as much attention to polished prose as the author gives to his woodworking, Korn&#x2019;s book is a stirring testimonial for self-fulfillment through craftsmanship, whatever form it takes. --Carl Hays</p><h2>Perfect Silence (A DI Callanach Thriller) (Book 4)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x2018;Relentless pace, devilish cleverness and a laser-sharp focus on plot.&#x2019; Chris Brookmyre</strong></p><p>When silence falls, who will hear their cries?</p><p>The body of a young girl is found dumped on the roadside on the outskirts of Edinburgh.

Drawing, punk rock, and the promise of true independence guide Goglu to adulthood while her home's daily chaos inevitably shapes her identity. <i>Susceptible</i> is a devastating graphic novel debut by Genevi�ve Castr�e; it's a testament to the heartbreaking loss of innocence when a child is forced to be the adult amongst grownups..</p></p><p><p><b>Genevi�ve Castr�e </b>was born in Qu�bec in 1981. Sometimes interdisciplinary, she is mostly known for her work as an illustrator and cartoonist. Impatient and lazy, Genevi�ve never officially studied "art". She has made a few books and has had a few exhibitions in places such as Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Genevi�ve Castr�e lives and works in the Pacific Northwest. She also has a music project called � PAON.</p>In a series of spare first-person vignettes, Castr�e pieces together the difficult childhood of Goglu, a French Canadian girl who lives with her alcoholic, self-destructive mother and distant, resentful stepfather. Goglu&#x2014;tomboyish and with a perpetual self-conscious blush&#x2014;strains against the influence of her genes, wondering where her own deep sadness comes from and hoping that she won&#x2019;t succumb to the same troublesome lifestyle of her mother, who is desperate for her daughter&#x2019;s attention and beset by manic episodes. As Goglu gets older, she seeks refuge in punk rock and drugs, but the strain of her destructive home life becomes too much to bear and she escapes to live with her biological father in Vancouver. Castr�e&#x2019;s black-and-white, Scarryesque illustrations accompany tiny, precise cursive lettering that gives the whole work a whispered, confessional quality, as if each word were an embarrassing secret. At times, Goglu&#x2019;s story is overwhelmingly, heartbreakingly sad, but Castr�e leaves a glimmer of hope: a redemptive future shaped by art, independence, and unconditional love. --Sarah Hunter</p><h2>Warsaw Pact Ground Forces (Elite, 10)</h2><p>Osprey&#39;s study of the ground forces of the Cold War (1946-1991).

With their lurid covers and wild, action-packed plots, these books reveal as much about society&#x2019;s deepest desires and fears as they do about the subcultures themselves. Featuring approximately 400 full-color covers, many of them never before reprinted, along with 70 in-depth author interviews, illustrated biographies, and previously unpublished articles, the book goes behind the scenes to look at the authors and publishers, how they worked, where they drew their inspiration and&#x2014;often overlooked&#x2014;the actual words they wrote. It is a must read for anyone interested in pulp fiction, lost literary history, retro and subcultural style, and the history of postwar youth culture.</p><p><b>Peter Doyle</b> is an Australian author, musician, and visual artist.

Ivan Vladislavic lays moments side by side like photographs on a table. He lucidly portrays a city and its many lives through reflections on memory, art, and what we should really be seeking.</p><p><b>Ivan Vladislavic</b> is the author of a number of prize-winning fiction and nonfiction books. He currently lives in Johannesburg, South Africa.</p><br></p><p>IVAN VLADISLAVIC is the author of the novels The Folly, The Restless Supermarket, The Exploded View and Double Negative. The last of these appeared initially in TJ/Double Negative, a joint project with the photographer David Goldblatt. Vladislavic has written extensively about Johannesburg, notably in Portrait with Keys (2006). He has edited volumes on architecture and art, and published a monograph on the conceptual artist Willem Boshoff. The compendium volume Flashback Hotel (2010) gathered together his early stories. Recent books are The Loss Library and Other Unfinished Stories, a reflection on writing and other things, and A Labour of Moles, a small comedy of meanings illustrated by Ornan Rotem. His work has won the Sunday Times Fiction Prize, the Alan Paton Award and the University of Johannesburg Prize, while TJ/Double Negative received the 2011 Kraszna-Krausz Award for best photography book."Vladislavic&#x2019;s narrative intelligence [is] nowhere more visible than in his way with language itself. Each section is perfectly judged; we enter incidents in medias res as though they were piano �tudes and exit them before we have overstayed our welcome." Teju Cole<br><br>"Vladislavic is sensitively attuned to the uncanny phenomena that explode from the social fault lines of his city." Patrick Flanery, <i>The Guardian (UK)</i><br><br>"Well received in his homeland, this publication marks the long-overdue arrival of one of South Africa&#x2019;s most finely tuned observers." Ted Hodgkinson, <i>The Times Literary Supplement (UK)</i><br><br>"This book coheres resplendently by its metaphorical underpinnings, by something rare in the world of contemporary fiction: meaning Double Negative listens carefully to the sound of the ebb and flow of history and transcribes it in lucid, rigorous prose; Vladislavic is no minor congener of Sebald." Neel Mukherjee, <i>The Independent (UK)</i><br><br>"A tone of bemused artistic entrapment in random patterns permeates this wonderfully soft-spoken novel, which reminds me very much of the work of J. M. Coetzee, W. G. Sebald and P. Auster. <i>Double Negative</i> even feels slightly fresher than the recent publications from these three giants of quirky flat-voiced first-person narrative postmodernism. Ivan Vladislavic is not actually a new voice in fiction, it turns out he&#x2019;s been publishing novels for decades but he was new to me when I picked up <i>Double Negative</i>, and this accessible novel may help him reach a larger audience." Levi Asher<br><br>"One of the most imaginative minds at work in South African literature today." Andr� Brink<br><br>"<i>Double Negative</i> was worth the wait." <i>The Quarterly Conversation</i><br><br>"A rare, brilliant writer. Vladislavic&#x2019;s work eschews all cant. Its sheer verve distinguishes it." <i>Sunday Times (SA)</i><br><br>"Vladislavic seeks the poetry of the city he has known and loved for 30 years He finds the human behind Johannesburg&#x2019;s sorry reputation." Ross Leckie, <i>The Times (SA)</i><br><br>"Deft, effortless and funny Double Negative shows one of South Africa&#x2019;s foremost writers in full flow." Craig MacKenzie, <i>Mail &amp; Guardian (SA)</i><br><br>"<i>Double Negative</i> is about, among other things, how art relates to life and history, if you like and its severe limits, which may also be its strengths The book is ambitious but resolutely unassuming; it is a triumph, if anything so sceptical, so taking due care, can be called such." Charles Boyle, <i>The Warwick Review</i><br><br>"Vladislavic is unquestionably a master of metaphor, literary imagery and pacing. This multi-layered book is a beautifully crafted narrative, an insightful meditation on art and memory, and a vibrant portrayal of Johannesburg. Slow, meticulous and poignant, like a skilfully produced black-and-white photograph." Megan Thomas, <i>The Lady</i><br><br>"<i>Double Negative</i> is a complex meditation on history, memory and those enigmatic freeze-frames of the past photography and their mutual relationship to the present." Kavish Chetty, <i>Cape Argus</i><br><br>"A widely-respected and award-winning writer in his home country, Vladislavic has been described by Andr� Brink as one of the most imaginative minds at work in South African literature today.'&#x2019;&#x2019; <i>Publishing Perspectives</i><br><br>"The recent loss of Nelson Mandela has led to much debate about what has changed in his new South Africa and to what degree the transition to full democracy has glossed over the injustices of the apartheid era; through a novel rich in discerning metaphors and delicate tableaux, Vladislavic exposes how deep the stain of the past remains." Jonathan Ruppin, Fiction of the Year, Foyles Blog<br><br>"Written with as much care as his fictional photographer takes over his work, Vladislavic conveys the changes in his own city of Johannesburg. He poses provocative questions about art, photography, digitalisation and commercialism It&#x2019;s brave, bold and different." Scarlett MccGwire, <i>Tribune</i><br><br>"The scale of the story here is small, but rather than diminishing the writing, it focuses it intensely. A great book." Bruce Dennill, <i>The Citizen</i><br><br>"As a post-apartheid novel, this is a breath of fresh air. It&#x2019;s a challenge to complacency, not a paean to liberation." Luke Davies, The <i>Literateur</i><br><br>"All of Vladislavic&#x2019;s tangential imperative in <i>Double Negative</i> can be taken as an articulation of a philosophy of photography. But the subject of photography in the novel, resorting to a factual analysis, is not tangential, but the axle on which it turns." Emmanuel Iduma, Africanah.org<br><br>"This is a novel about captured impressions and the ways in which an image can tell a thousand tales." <i>Buzz Magazine</i><br><br>"The author crafts the details of his [character&#x2019;s] life with a crystalline clarity." <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"This thought-provoking novel about race incited discussion through spirited, well-crafted dialogue." <i>Foreword</i><br><br>"Beautifully wrought, <i>Double Negative</i> is a clever and original piece of work, impressively structured and layered." M.A. Orthofer, <i>The Complete Review</i><br><br>"<i>Double Negative</i> is exceptionally well written. It captures an everyday life against the backdrop of South Africa&#x2019;s incredible revolution in an engaging portrait of a city and its many diverse citizens." <i>Kryosmagica</i><br><br>"The distinctive And Other Stories&#x2019; first-edition aesthetic means that this <i>Double Negative</i> is uncluttered: the French flaps work beautifully, retaining a subtlety in their gently layered revelation of information, reflecting, then, the novel they bracket the front flap has an unintroduced, unpaginated quote from the novel that impresses both the acute elegance of Vladislavic&#x2019;s prose and the novel&#x2019;s unflinching look at the altering processes of recording the fraught status of truth&#x2019; in the post-apartheid space." Katie Reid, <i>Africa in Words</i><br><br>"Double Negative is a multi-layered, complex novel, deceptive in its first-impression gentleness, and just like Nev, I&#x2019;m still experiencing the effects of it unfolding even after it has ended." Maia Nikitina, <i>Bookmunch</i><br><br>"For anyone who spends time thinking about what happens when you call something art, it is a book worth reading." <i>The Rookery in the Bookery</i><br><br>"When reading <i>Double Negative</i>, you have to appreciate the richness of the seemingly minor details, the subtle motion of everything. Only by paying attention to every detail can you enjoy the full spectrum of what Vladislavic offers." Leo P. Neufeld, <i>Alibi</i><br><br>"Double Negative is one of those novels that packs a lot in it is also a soulful meditation on life, love, money, and death." Ben Macnair, <i>Newbooks Mag</i><br><br>"Vladislavic&#x2019;s writing is beautiful, almost painterly in its subtlety The book is a treat from start to finish, illuminated by Teju Cole&#x2019;s fine introduction." <i>A Life in Books</i><br><br>"It&#x2019;s the novel that has most influenced me as a writer this year Reading it at the tail end of this year gave the story even greater resonance [a] concise but powerful examination of a small lives caught in the throes of great events." Dan Powell Fiction<br><br>"Vladislavic takes time and space to play with the politics of watching, and of being watched, so inherent in photography of any kind . . . Vladislavic&#x2019;s prose is delicately crafted; the metaphors sifted through a singular person&#x2019;s outlook on the world." <i>The Rookery in the Bookery</i><br><br>"The writing soars, Vladislavic does this on a couple of other occasions in the book where he allows the writing to kind of lift off and become very poetic. It&#x2019;s just beautiful, so, so well done I really love this book, I could waffle on about it for absolutely ages but I won&#x2019;t do that except to just say that you really should have a look at it Fantastic to discover another writer that I would never have discovered if it wasn&#x2019;t for publishers like And Other Stories." <i>Just William&#x2019;s Luck</i><br><br>"Ivan Vladislavic&#x2019;s <i>Double Negative</i> is a vivid and unique portrait of post-Apartheid Johannesburg." <i>Largehearted Boy</i><br><br>"The characters and the references could be read as a metaphor for South Africa moving through transition it became a little to laboured like an overloaded donkey traversing a rocky mountain path. Overall a nice study of a country and the moving powers, the uncertainty of the inhabitants and loss of a homeland." Tony Messenger, <i>Messy Booker</i><br><br>"For a simple story line, there is a lot to take from this novel and I really enjoyed being taken through Neville&#x2019;s Johannesburg." Lenna Stites, <i>San Francisco Book Review</i><br><br>"In <i>Double Negative</i>, Ivan Vladislavic has created an intriguing character study, and an examination of social change refracted through the experience of one individual."

How we perceive each other and ourselves, how individuals interact within groups, and how groups are structured--all these are the domain of social psychology. Many have doubted, however, that a full-fledged social psychology textbook can successfully be written from a Christian perspective. Inevitably, some say, when attempting to integrate theology and social psychology, one discipline must suffer at the expense of the other. Angela Sabates counters that thinking by demonstrating how these two disciplines can indeed be brought together in a fruitful way. She crisply covers key topics in social psychology, utilizing research that is well grounded in the empirical and theoretical literature, while demonstrating how a distinctively Christian approach can offer fresh ideas and understandings. <ul><li>Why doesn?t our behavior always match what we say we believe?</li><li>How and when are we most likely to be persuaded?</li><li>What is the social psychology of violence?</li><li>How reliable are eyewitness testimonies?</li><li>Are racism and prejudice on the decline or are we just better at hiding them?</li></ul> Sabates draws out the implications of a Christian view of human persons on these and other central subjects within the well-established framework of social psychological study. This volume is for those looking for a core text that makes use of a Christian theological perspective to explore what the science of psychology suggests to us about the nature of human social interaction.</p><p>Angela M. Sabates (Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois) is associate professor of psychology at Bethel University in St. Paul, Minnesota. She previously taught at Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, Florida, and she has worked professionally at Cornerstone Family Counseling Center (Fairfax, Virginia), Minirth-Meir and Byrd Clinic (Arlington, Virginia) and Reston Psychological Center and Lab School of Washington (Fairfax, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.).She contributed "The Child Patient" to <em>Christian Counseling Ethics</em> (IVP), and has written other articles for <em>Christian Counseling Today.</em>"Although Sabates' book lacks the glossy paper and splashy photographs of mainstream texts (and thus the cost is reasonable by textbook standards) . . . I encourage Christian social psychology faculty members to give this book a look. The content in the book is rich and can serve as a foundation for faculty members to explore related topics of their own choosing, as well as provide the starting point for many interesting classroom discussions. Faculty members using this text will find many opportunities to excite students about the rich and fertile field of social psychology." (Duane Kauffman, Journal of Psychology and Christianity, 2013, Vol. 32, No. 3)<br><br>"Angela Sabates's book is a thorough survey of current social psychological theory and research. It gives credit where it is due because, indeed, social psychologists have taught us much about the negative power of social situations as well as our capacities for distorted social perception. At the same time, her creation-fall-redemption framework suggests places where the current social psychological paradigm falls short and points to a research program that takes better account of our inherently positive--and still redeemable--social tendencies." (Mary Stewart Van Leeuwen, Eastern University)<br><br>"Finally (!), a social psychology textbook written from a solidly Christian perspective that rivals the best in an otherwise secular market. Utilizing the broad theological tenets of creation, fall and redemption, Angela Sabates skillfully demonstrates how thinking Christianly about social psychology can offer a bold alternative, yet without damaging the field's empirical goods. Cogent, well-written and comprehensive, this text will allow the student to use their Christian lenses without sacrificing a solid grounding in social psychology." (Peter Hill, Biola University)<br><br>"Angela M. Sabates has written a wonderful text aptly entitled <em>Social Psychology in Christian Perspective</em>. She fairly describes current approaches to social psychology yet she consistently critiques them through a Christian lens, respecting both empirical and theological methods. This will help students not only understand the fascinating subfield of social psychology, but it will also develop their critical reasoning abilities, helping them become Christians who can think like psychological scientists. This is a great text for any explicitly Christian college." (Everett L. Worthington, Jr., Virginia Commonwealth University)<br><br>"<em>Social Psychology in Christian Perspective</em> represents a much-needed alternative to the selection of social psychology textbooks that are currently on the market. Dr. Sabates has written an engaging text that encourages students to critically examine both the claims of a naturalistic approach to the discipline as well as a Christian integrative model. I'm looking forward to adopting it for my social psychology course."

After living there for seven years, our next house on Johnson Road seemed like a mansion. It had three bedrooms, two baths -- and a Laundromat! </p><p> While we were living back at the car lot, Michelle had managed our family's laundry with a single washer and dryer. But in the wintertime, the washer, which was out in a detached garage, would freeze up. Then she would have to carry all the family's dirty clothes to a self-service laundry in town. </p><p> It was a chore, loading all the baskets in and out of the car, in and out of the storefront laundry, and then back to the house while sometimes having to also corral a bunch of children. But there was an upside too: it took less than half the time to do the laundry, because while she was there, she could use multiple washers and dryers. </p><p> That gave me (Jim Bob) the idea of having our own Laundromat right at our house. I suggested to Michelle that we install two washers and three dryers in the Johnson Road house as we were remodeling it before we moved in. </p><p> She thought I was crazy. What family has two washers and three dryers in their home? But after we talked about it a little more, she agreed it could be a timesaver. So, over the year of the remodeling project, we watched for opportunities to buy high-quality used washers and dryers, and we've had our own Duggar family Laundromat ever since. (Now we have four washers and four dryers.) It may have been that first set of multiple laundry appliances that helped us realize, with five children and possibly more in the future, we needed to live differently from other families, who had only two or three children. We started looking for ideas and innovative ways to make the household run more efficiently. In this chapter, we'll share some of the organization tips, systems, and schedules that keep our household running smoothly. <b></b></p><p><b> Up, Away, and Out of Sight </b> </p><p> I (Michelle) am not a natural-born organizer, as some may be. But when we were living in the little house at the car lot and preparing to move to the Johnson Road house, I realized I had to get organized or I would go under. Someone recommended Emilie Barnes's book Survival for Busy Women, and I'm still using the methods and ideas that book taught me. After reading the book, I immediately started implementing Emilie's great tips for getting organized, including her system for simplifying a household move. The ideas I'm sharing here are based on or adapted from her ideas. </p><p> If you ask me, homes for big families, or maybe any size families, need almost as much storage space as living space. My goal has always been to keep most things like toys, games, books, and equipment out of sight and out of reach but easy to access. That plan keeps stored-away things out of the children's minds, so when they aren't using an item, they often forget about it. Then when we bring it out again, it's like receiving a new gift at Christmastime; they are so excited about playing with it again. Plus, it's something that hasn't been underfoot all the time. That practice, along with the children's lack of exposure to broadcast television advertisements promoting the latest new toy or game, keeps them from constantly asking to buy new toys and games. Another reward was that little hands or eyes were not reaching for or seeing those packed-away, out-of-reach items. I wasn't constantly tripping over things the little ones had pulled out -- or at least not as many things as I tripped over before! Emilie's system made things much easier. <b></b></p><p><b> Moving Methods </b> </p><p> Although we had "only" five children when we moved to the Johnson Road house, we had a lot of stuff, and moving it all when the remodeling was finished was going to be a really big job. It took us nearly a year to finish the remodeling, though, so I had lots of time to get packed. We were hoping to move before Jessa was born, and I met my goal of having everything packed a month before she was due in November 1992. </p><p> As it turned out, however, we didn't move until March 1993, so during those last few months at the car-lot house, we were living with the bare minimum while most of our belongings were packed in boxes. Emilie's system made that possible, and I loved getting a taste of how good it feels to have an uncluttered house! All the boxes were packed, labeled, and neatly stacked in a back room, ready for the move, but accessible in the meantime. Here's how we got organized for that move, and how we've stayed organized ever since. <b></b></p><p><b> 1-2-3, GO! </b> </p><p> <b>1. Sort</b> </p><p> The first step in getting organized, either for a move or just to simplify your life, is getting rid of stuff you don't need. If you move something you don't need, it can stay unused in a box somewhere for years, taking up space and adding clutter to your life. So I followed Emilie's suggestion to start by spending fifteen minutes at a time, cleaning out and packing one closet, one drawer, one shelf, one something. </p><p> You'll need three black plastic garbage bags. (It's important that you can't see through the bags so you won't be tempted to retrieve something from a bag once you've already sorted it.) One bag is for the stuff you're going to throw away. The second bag is for the things you're going to give away or sell at a yard sale. The third bag is for the items you're going to keep, either putting them back in the closet or drawer if you're simply organizing, or packing them into a box if you're moving. </p><p> If you're busy (as most moms of young children are), make it your goal to work just fifteen minutes at a time. It can seem overwhelming if you think you have to organize or pack a whole room at once, but knowing you're just going to work at it for fifteen minutes makes it seem more doable. Sometimes I would even set a kitchen timer so I knew when the fifteen minutes were up. Then I walked away until the next time I had fifteen minutes free. </p><p> Once you've sorted out that drawer or closet, you're ready to pack the keepers into a box. Even though it cost some money at a time when we were saving every penny possible, I chose to buy cardboard file-storage boxes with lids that were all the same size so they would stack easily and could be labeled clearly. I didn't want to use clear plastic boxes because I didn't want the children to be able to see what was inside and be tempted to dig stuff out. </p><p> <b>2. Label Boxes and Corresponding Index Cards</b> </p><p> The most important part about packing for moving or for storage is labeling the boxes according to an organized system and recording the contents on index cards. Yes, this takes a little time and is a bit tedious, and a lot of people skip this step. But it's absolutely crucial, especially if you're packing well ahead of your move, as I was. </p><p> Using a felt-tip marker, I color coded every box at the upper corner to show what room it went in. Then, on its corresponding file card, I used the same color to fill in a triangle covering the upper corner. I put these cards in a little recipe box. The color coding made it easy to see that like-colored boxes were stacked together when we moved them to the new house, with each color going to the appropriate room, right from the get-go. We didn't have to move the boxes again once we got them to the new house. </p><p> Each box was also clearly numbered. And on the index card numbered to correspond to that box, I wrote down each item I packed in that box. I wrote at the top of the card where the box was stored: in the pantry, the garage, or one of the bedrooms. I wrote everything in pencil so that later I could erase things that were removed from the box. </p><p> The system worked wonderfully when we moved, but it also made life lots easier before we moved. For instance, we were all packed up in November but didn't move until March so when we were hosting a big Thanksgiving dinner, I could get out the card file, go through the cards that were color coded for the kitchen, and easily find the big platter I wanted to use for the turkey. The system eliminated having to unpack and dig through twenty kitchen boxes. I would say to one of the older children, "Please go get box number twenty-three from the pantry shelf and bring it to me." </p><p> I packed seasonal things like Christmas decorations in those boxes for moving, and many of those decorations have been in those boxes or others like them ever since! The cards and the color-coded system let us know exactly which boxes contain specific Christmas things. So if I want to set out something early, like the ceramic Christmas tree that is a keepsake from my mother, I can send one of the kids to get box fifty-four out of the garage. </p><p> We asked a friend to design and build shelves in the pantry and laundry room at our Johnson Road house to custom fit the box system. This one thing helped tremendously to keep our cabinets and shelves clutter-free and much more organized. Every time I would go to get something out of a cabinet, I wasn't reaching around or knocking over items I used only occasionally to get to the one item I was really after. </p><p> We're still using the same system. Now we also store folded off-season clothing in labeled and color-coded boxes. Hanging off-season clothes go to an out-of-the-way closet. </p><p> <b>3. Write in Pencil So You Can Weed Out</b> </p><p> The system was also helpful in weeding out things we didn't need when it was time to move out of the Johnson Road house twelve years later. I went through the cards and put a little check by all the things I wanted to get rid of: items that were obsolete or those we had outgrown or no longer used. Or, if I planned to pass along items to other families that I knew could use them, I wrote their names beside the item on the card.

When the early church repudiated its Jewish roots, the New Testament became disconnected from its Hebraic foundations in the Old Testament. Edith Schaeffer presents a most convincing case for an unbreakable continuity in the flow of history from Genesis to Revelation. Her book reveals the thread of redemption in its Jewish context and Christianity as a grafted vine rooted in Judaism. The reader will hardly be able to miss the conclusion that the Christian gospel built on the foundation of the prophets and of the apostles is entirely Jewish. We live in a time when Christians and Jews are confused about their true identity and mutual calling to each other. This book deserves a re-edition at a time of unrelenting persistence of anti-Semitism, when much of the world turns their backs on Israel and the Jews. The global community of nations risks abandoning its Judeo-Christian heritage. This book&#39;s simple message may be what is needed to open the eyes of the Church to what Christianity owes to the Jews: gratitude, love, and the knowledge of their Jewish Messiah as the true Passover Lamb.</p><p>Edith Schaeffer is the author of more than 15 books, including L&#39;Abri (1969), Hidden Art (1971), Everybody Can Know (1973), A Way of Seeing (1977), Affliction (1978), The Tapestry, a biography of her family (1981), and Forever Music (1986).

It is first and foremost a diagnosis and critique of the secular religion of our time, humanitarianism, or the &#x201c;religion of humanity.&#x201d; It argues that the humanitarian impulse to regard modern man as the measure of all things has begun to corrupt Christianity itself, reducing it to an inordinate concern for &#x201c;social justice,&#x201d; radical political change, and an increasingly fanatical egalitarianism. Christianity thus loses its transcendental reference points at the same time that it undermines balanced political judgment. Humanitarians, secular or religious, confuse peace with pacifism, equitable social arrangements with socialism, and moral judgment with utopianism and sentimentality. <br><br> With a foreword by the distinguished political philosopher Pierre Manent, Mahoney&#x2019;s book follows Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in affirming that Christianity is in no way reducible to a &#x201c;humanitarian moral message.&#x201d; In a pungent if respectful analysis, it demonstrates that Pope Francis has increasingly confused the Gospel with left-wing humanitarianism and egalitarianism that owes little to classical or Christian wisdom. It takes its bearings from a series of thinkers (Orestes Brownson, Aurel Kolnai, Vladimir Soloviev, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn) who have been instructive critics of the &#x201c;religion of humanity.&#x201d; These thinkers were men of peace who rejected ideological pacifism and never confused Christianity with unthinking sentimentality. The book ends by affirming the power of reason, informed by revealed faith, to provide a humanizing alternative to utopian illusions and nihilistic despair.</p><p>Daniel J.

Early medieval Italy was the victim of many invasions and had a long succession of different Germanic rulers: Ostrogoths, Lombards, Franks, Germans, as well as the provincial administrations of the various Byzantine enclaves in Italy. Despite this, the structures of the Italian state persisted with considerable uniformity from the sixth to the ninth and tenth centuries, when they began to break apart under the pressure of other social forces. The real variations of early medieval Italian history came not in the histories of the Italian states, but in the different developments of the Italian regions, with all their contrasts---between city and country, mountain and plain, agriculture and pastoralism, landlord and tenant: regions kept apart by the difficult communications of a fairly mountainous country. In the end the Italian state could not hold the disparate forces together and Italy sprang apart.</p> <p>Chris Wickham chronicles these developments, describing political, economic, and social history as well as the regional history of southern Italy before showing how these forces combined as the state collapsed in the tenth century. This is the first time that the years between the Roman Empire and the rise of the Communes as a whole have been presented in the English language, making this book invaluable reading for all students of medieval Europe.</p></p><p>"In telling the story of the decline of the state in Italy he provides an English-reading audience with the first general account of early medieval Italian political history in their language."<br> &#x2014;<i>History Teacher</i> (<i>History Teacher</i> 1999-04-01)<br><br>"Chris Wickham's new book fills a real gap.

Each title includes simple charts and graphs to explain patterns of change and compare offspring to parent from a wide range of animal examples from near home and around the world.</p><p>Malaria Dreams is a tale of high adventure across Africa, recounted with the wit and humor that delighted readers of Night Train to Turkistan, Stuart Stevens's highly praised first book. <p>The story begins when a "geologist" friend mentions to Stevens that he has a Land Rover in the Central African Republic which he'd like to get back to Europe. It's only later, when Stevens discovers that half of Africa thinks his friend is a spy and the other half is convinced he's a diamond smuggler, that the intrepid author begins to realize he should have asked a few more questions before leaving home. And then there's the small problem of the Land Rover's seizure by the minister of mines, who has appropriated it as his personal car. It is a new Land Rover. The minister likes it very much. </p><p>Three months later, Stevens and his twenty-three-year-old companion (the only woman to ever transfer from Bryn Mawr to the University of Oklahoma) have somehow managed to drive-though not in the ill-fated Land Rover-across the wildest part of Africa, emerging scathed but still alive on the shores of the Mediterranean. </p><p>Malaria Dreams takes readers along on close encounters with killer ants in Cameroon, revolutionary soldiers in the middle of Lake Chad (a huge mudhole lacking any water), and strangely frenzied Peace Corps parties in Niger. There's a long search for a functional set of springs in Timbuktu and near disastrous bouts with sickness and automotive malfunctions in the middle of the Sahara. </p><p>Through it all, Stevens and his ex-fashion model companion battle the odds, and often each other, to return home to tell this unlikely, highly amusing tale. </p><p>"One of the funniest tales of misadventure to come along in quite a while.... Mr. Stevens has a wonderful eye for the curiosities of human behavior, Third World variety; he is witty, but not at the expense of the Africans."--The New Yorker </p><p>"Mr. Stevens emerges from the book not only as an engaging, picaresque hero, but also as a clever and observant writer."--The New York Times </p><p>"For an...Africa veteran, Stuart Stevens's Malaria Dreams will bring the pleasure of recognition. For all readers it brings much laughter."--The Wall Street Journal </p><p>"[Stevens's] depiction of exotic people and locales is often eloquent. And he succinctly limns the opulent and squalid vestiges of colonialism. Thankfully, he survived the adventure with his dry sense of humor intact."--The Cleveland Plain Dealer </p><p>"You would have to be out of your mind to go anywhere with Stuart Stevens, but when the travel is only mental, he is the perfect companion: brave, funny, and ever-watchful."--Martin Amis </p><p>Stuart Stevens is the author of the highly praised Atlantic Monthly Press travel book Night Train to Turkistan and Scorched Earth, "a political love story." He has written for the Emmy Award-winning television series Northern Exposure and I'll Fly Away and has published articles in Esquire, the New Republic, Outside, and other magazines. The Stuart Stevens Group political consulting firm has produced award-winning media campaigns for dozens of senatorial, congressional, and gubernatorial races around the country.</p>Stevens and a former fashion model drove a tortuous route from the Central African Republic to Europe via Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Mali and Algeria. "Stevens is the author of Night Train to Turkestan ; his offbeat African odyssey is a rollicking successor," asserted PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Captivating Lady Charlotte (Regency Brides: a Legacy of Grace, 2)</h2><p><i>Her heart is her own&#x2015;but her hand in marriage is another matter</i><br>Lady Charlotte Featherington is destined for great things on the marriage market.

Shaw, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, was one of the most romantic, heroic, and enigmatic figures of his day. The subject of myth and hagiography, he was equally accomplished in several fields--as archaeologist, diplomat, writer, and soldier--and he worked throughout World War I and after in the Middle East in efforts to promote independent Arab states. His autobiography <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i> is one of the greatest works of its kind. The esteemed military historian B. H. Liddell Hart wrote this study of Lawrence in order to pierce the clouds of legend. He discussed Lawrence's Oxford days, his experiences as an intelligence officer in Egypt, and in particular the tactics of guerrilla warfare he practiced so effectively against the large Turkish armies during World War I. Liddell Hart was one of the few to give Lawrence his full justice as both a man and a brilliant soldier. Long out-of-print, this book unravels the many puzzling features of Lawrence's story and restores him to his proper place as one of the twentieth century's heroic, but very human, figures.</p><p>Captain <b>Basil Henry Liddell Hart</b> (1895-1970) was one of the foremost military theorists of our time.

Promised to be the epitome of luxury, she was compared to both the first Queen Mary and even the Titanic, which had been the height of luxury one hundred years earlier.<br> <br>One by one the passengers filed aboard, checked in and were invited to the Grand Lounge, where they were met by white-gloved waiters offering champagne. When the last guest had come aboard, Captain Fairfax gave a speech of welcome.<br> <br>&#x201c;We promise you the most elegant voyage you have ever or will ever encounter,&#x201d; he said, his British accent adding even more luster to his words. &#x201c;You will find your suites furnished in the grand tradition of those of the most magnificent ocean liners of yesteryear. Queen Charlotte was constructed to accommodate precisely one hundred guests. Our eighty-five crew members are committed to serving you in every possible way. The entertainment will be worthy of Broadway, Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera. There will be a wide range of lectures to choose from. Our presenters include celebrity authors, former diplomats, and experts on Shakespeare and gemology. The finest chefs from around the globe will conduct farm-to-table cooking presentations. And we know that cruising is thirsty business. To remedy this hardship, there will be a series of wine tastings hosted by renowned connoisseurs. In keeping with the spirit of this cruise, one day there will be a lecture from the book of Emily Post, the legendary social arbiter of a century ago, illuminating the delightful manners of the past. These are only a few of the many activities you may choose from.<br> <br>&#x201c;In closing, the menus have been chosen from the recipes of the finest chefs the world over. Now, once again, welcome to your new home for the next six days.<br> <br>&#x201c;And now I would like to introduce Gregory Morrison, the owner of the Queen Charlotte. It was his vision that this ship would be perfect in every detail, and that is why you will enjoy the most luxurious cruise you will ever experience.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gregory Morrison, a stout, ruddy-faced, silver-haired man stepped forward.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to welcome all of you aboard. Today is the realization of a young boy&#x2019;s wish that began over fifty years ago. I stood next to my father, a tugboat captain, as he guided the most magnificent cruise ships of his day in and out of New York harbor. Truth be told, while my father was looking forward, toward where we were heading, I was looking back, watching in awe as spectacular cruise liners sliced elegantly through the gray Hudson River water. Even then I knew I wanted someday to build a ship even more awe-inspiring than the vessels I admired all those years ago. Queen Charlotte in all her majesty is the realization of the dream I dared to dream. Whether you are with us for five days to Southampton or stay with us for ninety days around the world, I hope today marks the beginning of an experience you will never forget.&#x201d; Raising his glass, he said, &#x201c;Anchors away.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a smattering of applause, then people turned to their nearest fellow passengers and began to chat. Alvirah and Willy Meehan, celebrating their forty-fifth wedding anniversary, were relishing their great fortune. Before they won the lottery, she had been cleaning houses and he had been repairing overflowing toilets and broken pipes.<br> <br>Thirty-four-year-old Ted Cavanaugh accepted a glass of champagne and looked around. He recognized some of the people on board, the chairmen of General Electric and Goldman Sachs, several Hollywood A-list couples.<br> <br>A voice next to him asked, &#x201c;By any chance would you be related to the ambassador Mark Cavanaugh? You bear a striking resemblance to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I am,&#x201d; Ted smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m his son.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew I couldn&#x2019;t be wrong. Let me introduce myself. I am Charles Chillingsworth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ted recognized the name of the retired ambassador to France.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your father and I were young attach�s together,&#x201d; Chillingsworth said. &#x201c;All the girls in the embassy were in love with your father. I told him no one deserved to be that good-looking. He served as ambassador to Egypt for two different presidents as I recall, then to the Court of St. James&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, he did,&#x201d; Ted confirmed. &#x201c;My father was fascinated by Egypt. And I share his passion. I spent many years growing up there. Then we moved to London when he became ambassador to Great Britain.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you followed in his footsteps?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I am a lawyer, but a good part of my practice is devoted to recovering antiques and artifacts that have been stolen from their countries of origin.&#x201d; What he did not say was that his specific reason for being on this voyage was to meet Lady Emily Haywood and persuade her to return her famed Cleopatra emerald necklace to its rightful owners, the people of Egypt.<br> <br>Professor Henry Longworth overheard the conversation and leaned in closer to hear the exchanges better, his eyes sparkling with interest. He had been invited aboard as a lecturer. A renowned expert on Shakespeare, his presentations, which always included renditions of passages, never failed to delight his audiences. A medium-sized man in his sixties, with thinning hair, he was a sought-after speaker on cruises and at colleges.<br> <br>Devon Michaelson stood a short distance apart from the other guests. He had no need or desire for the banal small talk that was the inevitable result of strangers meeting for the first time. Like Professor Longworth, he was in his early sixties with no outstanding height or remarkable facial features.<br> <br>Also standing by herself was twenty-eight-year-old Celia Kilbride. Tall, with black hair and sapphire-blue eyes, she did not notice, nor would she have cared about, the admiring glances that were cast at her by her fellow passengers.<br> <br>The first stop on the round-the-world voyage would be Southampton, England. That was where she would disembark. Like Professor Longworth she was an invited lecturer on the ship. A gemologist, her subject would be the history of famous jewels through the ages.<br> <br>The most excited passenger in the room was fifty-six-year-old divorc�e Anna DeMille of Kansas, who had been the grand-prize winner of this trip in a church-sponsored raffle. Her dyed black hair and matching eyebrows were bold against her thin face and body. Her prayer was that this would be her opportunity to meet Mr. Right. Why not? she asked herself. I won the raffle. Maybe this is finally going to be my year.<br> <br>Eighty-six-year-old Lady Emily Haywood, famed for her wealth and philanthropy, was attended by the guests she had invited: Brenda Martin, her assistant and companion over the last twenty years, Roger Pearson, who was both her investment manager and the executor of her estate, and Roger&#x2019;s wife Yvonne.<br> <br>When interviewed about the cruise, Lady Emily had stated that she intended to bring her legendary Cleopatra emerald necklace and wear it in public for the first time.<br> <br>As the passengers began to disperse, wishing each other &#x201c;Bon voyage,&#x201d; they could not know that at least one of them would not reach Southampton alive.</p><h2>In</h2><p><i>I only want to stay in.<br> In my pajamas.<br> Inside.<br> In.

Lloyd-Jones: What can be more profitable, next to the Bible itself, than to read something of the life of such a man as George Whitefield and to read his own words? The famous essay by Bishop Ryle is certainly the best short account of Whitefield that has ever been done, and it is good that it should be thus reprinted. At the same time this volume provides samples of the great preacher's sermons.

The famous essay by Bishop Ryle (included in this volume) is certainly the best short account of Whitefield ever done.' --<i><strong>D. MARTYN LLOYD-JONES</strong></i></p><h2>Atlantis: Poems</h2><p>The poignant, accomplished new collection of poetry from the author of <em>My Alexandria</em>--1993 winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, Los Angeles Times Book Award, 1993 National Book Award Finalist.</p><p>"I was so filled with longing / --is that what sound is for?-- / I seemed to be nowhere at all," Mark Doty rhapsodizes while watching geese fly in "Migratory," another double vision in his award-winning fourth book, <i>Atlantis</i>. Forming a moving elegy to the poet's lover, Wally, the individual tercets and couplets speak in a cautious but brave rhetoric combining the best of Frost and Bishop. The book removes its mourning clothes and goes downtown, full of rage, to sit in the steam baths of the edgy "Homo Will Not Inherit," in which the speaker says, "I'll tell you what I'll inherit: the margins." Indeed, Doty's speakers are most likely found in tidal, watery margins that indulge his double vision of land and sea interweaving like body and spirit. Atlantis begins merely as marshland uncovered at low tide:<p> </p><blockquote> Now the tide's begun<br> its clockwork turn, pouring,<p> in the day's hourglass<br> toward the other side of the world,</p><p> and our dependable marsh reappears<br> ...And our ongoingness,</p><p> what there'll be of us? Look, <br> love, the lost world</p><p> rising from the waters again: <br> our continent, where it always was.... </p></blockquote> This austerity lapses into sentimentality only once, when Wally pets a dog. Yet even here, Doty delivers an aesthetic message, that the touch "isn't about grasping / ...so much will / must be summoned, / such attention brought / to the work--which is all / he is now, this gesture." It is as though Wally's death has released Doty from the uneasy assurances of earlier poems, causing him to rediscover how life exists in metaphor, and at one remove, the language of poetry. "Description is travel," he writes, and like Frost in "Birches," he travels along his metaphors, climbing until they bend and bring him back to a world changed by the experience. <i>Atlantis</i> and his previous book, <i>My Alexandria</i>, are valuable chronicles of sensibility and intelligence laid bare. <i>-- Edward Skoog</i>In his latest collection, Atlantis, Doty claims the mythical lost island as his own: a fading paradise whose memory he must keep alive at the same time that he is forced to renounce its hold on him. Atlantis recedes, just as the lives of those Doty loves continue to be extinguished by the devastation of AIDS. Set in the harbor village of Provincetown, whose charming, cluttered landscape Doty brings to life, the collection chronicles the illness and death of Doty&#39;s beloved partner, as well as many others whose worlds have been both ravaged and broadened by this disease. Doty&#39;s struggle is to reconcile with, and even to celebrate, the evanescence of our earthly connections - to those we love, to the shifting physical landscape, even to our strongest feelings - and to understand how we can love more at the very moment that we must consent to let go.</p><h2>Fever Season (Benjamin January, Book 2)</h2><p>Benjamin January made his debut in bestselling author Barbara Hambly's <b>A Free Man of Color</b>, a haunting m�lange of history and mystery. Now he returns in another novel of greed, madness, and murder amid the dark shadows and dazzling society of old New Orleans, named a Notable Book of the Year by the <i>New York Times</i>.<br><br>The summer of 1833 has been one of brazen heat and brutal pestilence, as the city is stalked by Bronze John&#x2014;the popular name for the deadly yellow fever epidemic that tests the healing skills of doctor and voodoo alike. Even as Benjamin January tends the dying at Charity Hospital during the steaming nights, he continues his work as a music teacher during the day.<br><br>When he is asked to pass a message from a runaway slave to the servant of one of his students, January finds himself swept into a tempest of lies, greed, and murder that rivals the storms battering New Orleans. And to find the truth he must risk his freedom...and his very life.</p><p>In New Orleans in 1833, appearance is everything for people of color. "His own coat and waistcoat ... were one badge of his freedom," Barbara Hambly writes about Ben January, a surgeon and teacher of music. "Even more than the papers the law demanded he carry--and as much as the well-bred French his tutors and his mother had hammered into him as a child--they said, This is a free man of color, not somebody's property to be bought and sold." When the veteran science fiction writer Hambly first introduced January, in the stunning and heartbreaking <i>A Free Man of Color</i>, the only problem seemed to be that the book told us so much about a vanished world that it couldn't possibly support a sequel. Fortunately, Hambly has found a way to make it work by putting January into a real crime, the case of a woman named Delphine Lalaurie whose savagery toward her slaves managed to shock even her contemporaries. "She was a tall woman, imperially straight; and though nearly every Creole woman of her age had surrendered to rich food and <i>embonpoint</i>, she retained the slim figure of a girl," Hambly writes of the majestic Delphine on her first meeting with January. She has come to the reeking, corpse-clogged hospital where January is working during a cholera epidemic to warn him about helping a runaway slave girl accused of murder. Ignoring that warning puts January into a situation so full of danger to himself and others that in lesser hands it could easily have become overwrought. Hambly, however, knows better than anyone that readers connect to characters rooted in honesty, regardless of how alien their environment may seem to us. <i>--Dick Adler</i>"Superb.

Its author, Jalaloddin Rumi, was a poet and mystic of the highest attainment, but he was first and foremost a spiritual teacher, and his <i>Masnavi</i> is a ladder to the spiritual world, leading the reader to the ultimate goal of the Sufi path-union with God. Alan Williams's translation into blank verse beautifully conveys the poetry of the original Persian couplets, while his introduction discusses how the modern reader might approach Rumi's writing.</p><p>Called 'Jelaluddin Balkhi' by the Persians and Afghans, <b>Rumi</b> was born on September 30, 1207, in Balkh, Afghanistan, then a part of the Persian Empire. He was the greatest mystical poet of Persia, famous for his didactic epic <i>Masnavi-ye Ma'navi</i> (<i>Spiritual Couplets</i>), a treasure-house of Sufi mysticism. Rumi died on December 17, 1273. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Alan Williams</b> is Senior Lecturer in Comparative Religion at the University of Manchester.This volume contains a dozen stories from Book One of the six-volume collection, composed in rhyming couplets by the Afghan/Persian poet Rumi in the 1260s. With Anton Lesser's patient, precise narration, and Naxos's quality production, these religious stories are accessible to a wider audience. Without being effeminate, Lesser's voice is unusually high pitched for a man's voice, which may be jarring at first for some listeners. But his classical but unpretentious Shakespearean style, perfectly paced, makes this set worthy of repeated listening. Persian music, commissioned for this recording, sets the tone.

Their range, too, is unusually great, for besides the many plates on the costumes of the Greeks and Romans, there are representative illustrations of the typical dress of such other civilizations as the Phrygian, Egyptian, Parthian, Etruscan, and Persian.<br>In addition, scores of engravings are devoted to such now-forgotten objects as ancient musical instruments (the lyre, double flute, pipes of Pan, etc.), Bacchanalian implements, articles of furniture, women's trinkets and jewelry, sarcophagi, altars, and other adjuncts to ancient life.<br>Such comprehensiveness makes this book indispensable to costume designers, stage fitters, and producers of classic plays, students of fashion design, and others interested in ancient costumes. The material included here is covered in no ordinary history, and only here can the interested reader discover just how the draping of the Greek robe was achieved, or what was worn at festivals and funerals by the various classes.<br>Art directors, advertising managers, and others on the lookout for unusual and eye-catching illustrations will also treasure this collection. All of the engravings are royalty free and may be used in any way, whether as striking contrasts to modern styles in dress, jewelry, or furniture; for historical perspective; for mood pieces; or simply as unusual attention-getters.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Forging Freedom: The Formation of Philadelphia&#x2019;s Black Community, 1720&#x2013;1840</h2><p><p>This book is the first to trace the good and bad fortunes, over more than a century, of the earliest large free black community in the United States. Gary Nash shows how, from colonial times through the Revolution and into the turbulent 1830s, blacks in the City of Brotherly Love struggled to shape a family life, gain occupational competence, organize churches, establish neighborhoods and social networks, advance cultural institutions, educate their children in schools, forge a political consciousness, and train black leaders who would help abolish slavery. These early generations of urban blacks&#x2015;many of them newly emancipated&#x2015;constructed a rich and varied community life.</p><p>Nash&#x2019;s account includes elements of both poignant triumph and profound tragedy. Keeping in focus both the internal life of the black community and race relations in Philadelphia generally, he portrays first the remarkable vibrancy of black institution-building, ordinary life, and relatively amicable race relations, and then rising racial antagonism. The promise of a racially harmonious society that took form in the postrevolutionary era, involving the integration into the white republic of African people brutalized under slavery, was ultimately unfulfilled. Such hopes collapsed amid racial conflict and intensifying racial discrimination by the 1820s. This failure of the great and much-watched &#x201c;Philadelphia experiment&#x201d; prefigured the course of race relations in America in our own century, an enduringly tragic part of this country&#x2019;s past.</p></p><p>Gary B. Nash is Professor of History Emeritus, University of California, Los Angeles, and Professor and Director, National Center for History in the Schools.&#x201c;Now comes this superbly written book by Gary Nash, one of the prolific scholars on the subject, on the early history of the races at a particularly crucial juncture that occurred in the city of Philadelphia that sheds insight into the entire process... A particular strength of his work lies in his detailing of the resiliency and creativity of black culture in the city.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Joseph Boskin</b><b>, </b><b><i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Nash&#x2019;s book is a major contribution to our understanding of black life in the early American republic; it is a vivid and compelling account of the evolution of Philadelphia&#x2019;s black community in a period of increasing racism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Foner</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Historical Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A compelling view of the development of black urban culture and society in Philadelphia. Masterfully researched and skillfully combining social scientific data and traditional documents, this work succeeds admirably as narrative and analysis. It easily ranks among the best work in the fields of black urban history and early American race relations.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Waldo E. Martin, Jr.</b><b>, </b><b><i>William &amp; Mary Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gary Nash&#x2019;s <i>Forging Freedom</i> is the most important book on the black experience in an American city yet written... No book better reveals how the early black experience in America became so persistently urban and naggingly ambivalent. No book better reveals how politics, social conditions, and religiosity in a colonial Quaker metropolis shaped modern Afro-American culture. And no book better demonstrates how hard-won, carefully sculpted, historical research, sophisticated interpretation, and clear, unambiguous prose remain the historian&#x2019;s finest achievement. <i>Forging Freedom</i> is a triumph, most obviously for Nash, but most beneficially for any student of America who wants to know how and why our deepest, most enduring paradoxes found their origins so early and so tragically in urban racial tension.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jon Butler, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A distinguished historian has given us a gift of major proportion. Nash presents a fascinating and unknown picture in remarkable detail. This moving and well-documented case study stretches all the way from Philadelphia&#x2019;s early Quaker years to the agitation and conflict of the antebellum era. Students of later civil rights movements will be amazed by how far back the story goes, how familiar it sounds in certain parts, and how much of it can be recovered by a patient and determined scholar.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter H. Wood, Duke University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Nash is our preeminent historian of the early seaboard cities and a leading scholar of the black experience and race relations in early America. His research is energetic, absolutely current, very nearly exhaustive, and it yields an account that is vibrantly rendered. Much of the best material is on the blacks, much of the most horrifying on the whites, but always he maintains a difficult balance, capturing episodes and events as well as deeper trends on both sides of the racial divide in a narrative at once teeming and telling.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Zuckerman, University of Pennsylvania</b></p><h2>Tejanos and Texas under the Mexican Flag, 1821-1836 (Volume 54) (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&amp;M University)</h2><p>Historians have amply recorded the battles and the Anglo-Americans&#39; military, economic, and political domination of the Mexican lands after 1836. But few studies have documented the reverse flow in the interchange while Anglo and Mexican co-existed under the Mexican flag in the previous years. Andr�s Tijerina&#39;s book, focusing on Texas between 1821 and 1836, provides background facts for a better understanding of the exchange of land, power, culture, and social institutions that took place between the Anglo-American frontier and the Hispanic frontier during those critical years. To be sure, the dramatic shift in land and resources greatly affected the Mexican, but it had its effect on the Anglo American as well. After the 1820s, many of the Anglo-American pioneers changed from buckskin-clad farmers to cattle ranchers who wore boots and &#34;cowboy&#34; hats. They learned to ride heavy Mexican saddles mounted on horses taken from the wild mustang herds of Texas. They drove great herds of longhorns north and westward, spreading the Mexican life-style and ranch economy as they went. With the cattle ranch went many words, practices, and legal principles that had been developed long before by the native Mexicans of Texas--the Tejanos. In this book, Andr�s Tijerina documents the two-way cultural exchange in the years under the Mexican flag. It describes the basic institutions of Tejano life and culture, and it documents their transmission to the Anglo-American frontier. The work is a foundation for the study of the early Mexican-American culture in Texas and its influence on Texans of all ethnic backgrounds.</p><p>Andr�s Tijerina holds degrees from Texas A&amp;M University, Texas Tech University, and the University of Texas.

Taking the journey again&nbsp;through these pictures, I have been intrigued and even somewhat reassured that America is changing not quite so fast as we often believe. The photographs, happily, reveal a recognizable&nbsp;continuity &#x2013; but for how much longer who can say &#x2013; and I'm glad the Ailors have recorded so many places and people from <i>Blue Highways</i> while they are yet with us." <br> Through illustrative photography and text, Ailor and his son capture once more the local color and beauty of the back roads, cafes, taverns, and people of Heat-Moon&#x2019;s original trek. Almost every photograph in Blue Highways <i>Revisited</i> is referenced to a page in the original work. With side-by-side photographic comparisons of eleven of Heat-Moon&#x2019;s characters, this new volume reflects upon and develops the memoir of Heat-Moon&#x2019;s cross-country study of American culture and spirit.&nbsp;Photographs of Heat-Moon&#x2019;s logbook entries, original manuscript pages, Olympia typewriter, Ford van, and other artifacts also give readers insight into Heat-Moon&#x2019;s approach to his trip. Discussions with Heat-Moon about these archival images provide the reader insight into the travels and the writing of <i>Blue Highways</i> that only the perspective of the author could provide.<br> Blue Highways<i> Revisited</i> reaffirms that the "blue highway" serves as a romantic symbol of the free and restless American spirit, as the Ailors lose themselves to the open road as Heat-Moon did thirty years previously. This book reminds readers of the insatiable attraction of the &#x201c;blue highway&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;But in those brevities just before dawn and a little after dusk&#x2014;times neither day or night&#x2014;the old roads return to the sky some of its color.&nbsp;Then, in truth, they carry a mysterious cast of blue, and it's that time when the pull of the blue highway is strongest, when the open road is a beckoning, a strangeness, a place where a man can lose himself&#x201d; (Introduction to <i>Blue Highways</i>).</p><p><p>Released for publication on the 30th anniversary of <i>Blue Highways</i>, this book retraces William Least Heat-Moon&#x2019;s route.</p><b>Edgar I.

At first she misses life back home in the city, but soon she grows to love everything about her new surroundings -- the glimmering fireflies, the glorious landscape, and something else, deep within the water, that only Maddy sees. Could it be a mermaid? As her grandmother shares wisdom about sayings and signs, Maddy realizes she may be only the sibling to carry on her family's magical legacy. And when a disastrous oil leak threatens the bayou, she knows she may also be the only one who can help. Does she have what it takes to be a hero?<br>A coming-of-age tale rich with folk magic, set in the wake of the Gulf oil spill, <i>Bayou Magic </i>celebrates hope, friendship, and family, and captures the wonder of life in the Deep South.</p><p>Jewell Parker Rhodes is the author of <i>Ninth Ward</i>, a Coretta Scott King honor book, and <i>Sugar</i>, winner of the Jane Adams Peace Association book award.

When Toby goes missing and is presumed dead, the devastated Elinor refuses to accept it. Then she finds a letter hidden among his belongings; it reveals that Toby knew he wasn&#x2019;t coming back and implies that his friend, medic Kit Neville, knows why. But Kit has been horribly disfigured and is reeling from shell shock. While Elinor tries to piece together the mystery of what happened to her brother, she uses her drawing skills to aid in the surgical reconstruction of those who have suffered unspeakable losses&#x2014;of their faces, their memories, their very minds.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Pat Barker is the author of numerous novels, including&nbsp;<i>Noonday</i>,&nbsp;<i>Toby's Room,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Life Class</i>, as well as the highly acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy:&nbsp;<i>Regeneration</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Eye in the Door</i>, winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize; and&nbsp;<i>The Ghost Road</i>, winner of the Booker Prize. She lives in the north of England.1<br><br>Elinor arrived home at four o&#x2019;clock on Friday and went straight to her room. She hung the red dress on the wardrobe door, glancing at it from time to time as she brushed her hair. That neckline seemed to be getting lower by the minute. In the end her nerve failed her. She hunted out her pink dress, the one she used to wear for dancing classes at school, put it on, and stood in front of the cheval mirror. She turned her head from side to side, her hands smoothing down the creases that had gathered round the waist. Oh dear. No, no, she couldn&#x2019;t do it, not this time, not ever again. She wriggled out of it and threw it to the back of the wardrobe. Out of the window would have been more satisfying, but her father and brother-in-law were sitting on the terrace. She pulled the red dress over her head, tugged the neckline up as far as it would go, and went reluctantly downstairs.<br><br>Father met her in the hall and hugged her as if he hadn&#x2019;t seen her for a year. Outside the living room, she hesitated, but there was no point wearing a red dress and then creeping along the skirting boards like a mouse, so she flung the door open and swept in. She kissed Rachel, waved at Rachel&#x2019;s husband, Tim, who was at the far side of the room talking to her mother, and then looked around for Toby, but he wasn&#x2019;t there. Perhaps he wasn&#x2019;t coming after all, though he&#x2019;d said he would. The prospect of his absence darkened the whole evening; she wasn&#x2019;t sure she could face it on her own. But then, a few minutes later, he came in, apologizing profusely, damp hair sticking to his forehead. He must&#x2019;ve been for a swim. She wished she&#x2019;d known; she&#x2019;d have gone with him. Not much hope of talking to him now; Mother had already beckoned him to her side.<br><br>Rachel was asking Elinor question after question about her life in London, who she met, who she went out with, did she have any particular friends? Elinor said as little as possible, looking for an excuse to get away. It was supplied by her mother, who appeared at her side and hissed, &#x201c;Elinor, go upstairs at once and take that ridiculous dress off.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment the gong sounded. Elinor spread her hands, all injured innocence, though underneath she felt hurt and humiliated. Yet again, she was being treated like a child.<br><br>Father came in at the last minute just as they were sitting down. She wondered at the curious mixture of poking and prying and secrecy that ruled their lives. Mother and Father saw very little of each other. She needed country air for the sake of her health; he lived at his club because it was such a convenient walking distance from the hospital, where he often had to be available late at night. Was that the reason for their weeklong separation? She doubted it. Once, crossing Tottenham Court Road, she&#x2019;d seen her father with a young woman, younger even than Rachel. They&#x2019;d just come out of a restaurant. The girl had stood, holding her wrap tightly round her thin shoulders, while Father flagged down a cab and helped her into it, and then they were whirled away into the stream of traffic. Elinor had stood and watched, open-mouthed. Father hadn&#x2019;t seen her; she was sure of that. She&#x2019;d never mentioned that incident to anyone, not even to Toby, though she and Toby were the only members of the family who kept no secrets from each other.<br><br>She sat in virtual silence for the first half of the meal&#x2014;sulking, her mother would have said&#x2014;though Tim did his clumsy best to tease her out of it. Did she have a young man yet? Was all this moodiness because she was in love?<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no time for anything like that,&#x201d; Elinor said, crisply. &#x201c;They work us too hard.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you know what they say, don&#x2019;t you? All work and no play . . . ?&#x201d; He turned to Toby. &#x201c;Have you seen her with anybody?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet, but I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s only a matter of time.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby&#x2019;s joining in the teasing, however reluctantly, was all it took to chafe Elinor&#x2019;s irritation into fury.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, if you must know I have met somebody.&#x201d; She plucked a name from the air. &#x201c;Kit Neville.&#x201d;<br><br>This was not true: she&#x2019;d hardly spoken to Kit Neville. He was merely the loudest, the most self-confident, the most opinionated, and, in many ways, the most obnoxious male student in her year, and therefore the person she thought of first.<br><br>&#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d; Mother asked. Predictably.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a student.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What sort of student?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Art. What else would he be doing at the Slade?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Have you met his family?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now why on earth would I want to do that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s what people do when&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When they&#x2019;re about to get engaged? Well, I&#x2019;m not. We&#x2019;re just friends. Very good friends, but . . . friends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need to be careful, Elinor,&#x201d; Rachel said. &#x201c;Living in London on your own. You don&#x2019;t want to get a reputation . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do want to get a reputation, as it happens. I want to get a reputation as a painter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know what I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Elinor,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough.&#x201d;<br><br>So even Father was turning against her. The last mouthful of cheese and biscuit sticking in her dry throat, Elinor followed her mother and Rachel out of the dining room. They sat over a pot of coffee that nobody wanted, staring at their reflections in the black windows that overlooked the airless terrace. The windows couldn&#x2019;t be opened because of moths. Rachel had a horror of moths.<br><br>&#x201c;So who is this Mr. Neville?&#x201d; Mother asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody, he&#x2019;s in my year, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you said classes weren&#x2019;t mixed?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some are, some aren&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She could barely speak for exasperation; she&#x2019;d brought this on herself. &#x201c;Look, it&#x2019;s not as if we&#x2019;re going out . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So why mention him?&#x201d; Rachel&#x2019;s voice was slurry with tiredness. Tendrils of damp hair stuck to her forehead; she&#x2019;d eaten scarcely anything. She yawned and stretched her ankles out in front of her. &#x201c;Look at them. Puddings.&#x201d; She dug her fingers into the swollen flesh as if she hated it.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be worn out in this heat,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you put your feet up?&#x201d;<br><br>Feet up in the drawing room? Unheard of. But then Elinor intercepted a glance between the two women, and understood. She wondered when she was going to be told. What a family they were for not speaking. She wanted to jump on the table and shout out every miserable little secret they possessed, though, apart from the breakdown of her parents&#x2019; marriage, she couldn&#x2019;t have said what the secrets were. But there was something: a shadow underneath the water. Swim too close and you&#x2019;d cut your feet. A childhood memory surfaced. On holiday somewhere, she&#x2019;d cut her foot on a submerged rock; she&#x2019;d felt no pain, only the shock of seeing her blood smoking into the water. Toby had taken off his shirt and wrapped it round her foot, then helped her back to the promenade. She remembered his pink fingers, wrinkled from the sea, the whorl of hair on the top of his head as he bent down to examine the cut.<br><br>Why couldn&#x2019;t they leave her alone? All this nonsense about young men . . . It was just another way of drilling it into you that the real business of a girl&#x2019;s life was to find a husband. Painting was, at best, an accomplishment; at worst, a waste of time. She was trying to hold on to her anger, but she&#x2019;d suppressed it so long it was threatening to dissipate into depression. As it so often did. Why hadn&#x2019;t Toby spoken up for her? Instead of just sitting there, fiddling with his knife and fork.<br><br>She was thoroughly fed up. As soon as possible after the men joined them, she excused herself, saying she needed an early night.<br><br>As she closed the door behind her, she heard Father ask, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with her?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, you know,&#x201d; Mother said. &#x201c;Girls.&#x201d;<br><br>Meaning? Nothing that made her feel better about herself, or them.<br>Next morning after breakfast Toby announced that he was going to walk to the old mill.<br><br>&#x201c;In this heat?&#x201d; Mother said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not too bad. Anyway, it&#x2019;ll be cooler by the river.&#x201d;<br><br>Elinor followed him into the hall. &#x201c;Do you mind if I come?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Toby, I walk all over London.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let Rachel hear you say that. Rep-u-tation!&#x201d;<br><br>They arranged to meet on the terrace. Soon Elinor was following her brother across the meadow, feeling the silken caress of long grasses against her bare arms and the occasional cool shock of cuckoo spit.<br><br>&#x201c;You know this chap you were talking about last night . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t you start.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was only asking.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I only mentioned him because I&#x2019;m sick of being teased. I just wanted to get Tim off my back. Instead of which, I got Mother onto it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And Rachel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s worse than Mother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s jealous, that&#x2019;s all. She settled down a bit too early and . . . Well, she didn&#x2019;t exactly get a bargain, did she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like Tim, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s harmless. I just don&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;s very happy.&#x201d; He turned to face her. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t make that mistake, will you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marrying Tim? Shouldn&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No-o. Settling down too early.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t intend to &#x2018;settle down&#x2019; at all.&#x201d;<br><br>She hoped that was the end of the subject, but a minute later Toby said, &#x201c;All the same, there has to be a reason you mentioned him&#x2014;I mean, him, rather than somebody else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s perfectly obnoxious, that&#x2019;s why. He was just the first person who came to mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Once they reached the river path, there was some shade at last, though the flashing of sunlight through the leaves and branches was oddly disorientating, and more than once she tripped over a root or jarred herself stepping on air.<br><br>&#x201c;Be easier coming back,&#x201d; Toby said. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t have the sun in our eyes.&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t want to go on talking. She was content to let images rise and fall in her mind: her lodgings in London, the Antiques Room at the Slade, the friends she was starting to make, the first few spindly shoots of independence, though it all seemed a little unreal here, in this thick heat, with dusty leaves grazing the side of her face and swarms of insects making a constant humming in the green shade.<br><br>She was walking along, hardly aware of her surroundings, when a sudden fierce buzzing broke into her trance. Toby caught her arm. Bluebottles, gleaming sapphire and emerald, were glued to a heap of droppings in the center of the path. A few stragglers zoomed drunkenly towards her, fastening on her eyes and lips. She spat, batting them away.<br><br>&#x201c;Here, this way,&#x201d; Toby said. He was holding a branch for her so she could edge past the seething mass.<br><br>&#x201c;Fox?&#x201d; she asked, meaning the droppings.<br><br>&#x201c;Badger, I think. There&#x2019;s a sett up there.&#x201d;<br><br>She peered through the trees, but couldn&#x2019;t see it.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you remember we had a den here once?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>She remembered the den: a small, dark, smelly place under some rhododendron bushes. Tiny black insects crawled over your skin and fell into your hair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it was here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was. You could just hear the weir.&#x201d;<br><br>She listened, and sure enough, between the trees, barely audible, came the sound of rushing water.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right, I remember now. I thought it was a bit farther on.&#x201d;<br><br>She thought he might want to go there, he lingered so long, but then he turned and walked on.<br><br>The river was flowing faster now, picking up leaves and twigs and tiny, struggling insects and whirling them away, and the trees were beginning to thin out. More and more light reached the path until, at last, they came out into an open field that sloped gently down towards the weir. A disused mill&#x2014;the target of their walk&#x2014;stood at the water&#x2019;s edge, though it was many years since its wheel had turned.<br><br>This had been the forbidden place of their childhood. They were not to go in there, Mother would say. The floorboards were rotten, the ceilings liable to collapse at any minute . . .<br><br>&#x201c;And don&#x2019;t go near the water,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d call after them, in a last desperate attempt to keep them safe, as they walked away from her down the drive. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; they&#x2019;d chorus. &#x201c;Promise,&#x201d; Toby would add, for good measure, and then they would glance sideways at each other, red-faced from trying not to giggle.<br><br>Now, Elinor thought, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t bother going in, but Toby went straight to the side window, prised the boards apart, and hoisted himself over the sill. After a second&#x2019;s hesitation Elinor followed.<br><br>Blindness, after the blaze of sunlight. Then, gradually, things became clear: old beams, cobwebs, tracks of children&#x2019;s footprints on the dusty floor. Their own footprints? No, of course not, couldn&#x2019;t be, not after all these years. Other children came here now. She put her foot next to one of the prints, marveling at the difference in size. Toby, meanwhile, was expressing amazement at having to duck to avoid the beams.<br><br>Because this place had been the scene of so many forbidden adventures, an air of excitement still clung to it, in spite of the dingy surroundings. She went across to the window and peered out through a hole in the wall. &#x201c;I wonder what it was like to work here.&#x201d;<br><br>Toby came across and stood beside her. &#x201c;Pretty good hell, I should think. Noise and dust.&#x201d;<br><br>He was right, of course; when the wheel turned the whole place must have shook. She turned to him. &#x201c;What do you think&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br><br>He grabbed her arms and pulled her towards him. Crushed against his chest, hardly able to breathe, she laughed and struggled, taking this for the start of some childish game, but then his lips fastened onto hers with a groping hunger that shocked her into stillness. His tongue thrust between her lips, a strong, muscular presence. She felt his chin rough against her cheek, the breadth of his chest and shoulders, not that round, androgynous, childish softness that had sometimes made them seem like two halves of a single person. She started to struggle again, really struggle, but his hand came up and cupped her breast and she felt herself softening, flowing towards him, as if something hard and impacted in the pit of her stomach had begun to melt.<br><br>And then, abruptly, he pushed her away.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m sorry. Sorry, sorry . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t speak. How was it possible that anybody, in a single moment, could stumble into a chasm so deep there was no getting out of it?<br><br>&#x201c;Look, you go back,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come home later.&#x201d;<br><br>Automatically, she turned to go, but then remembered the river and turned back.<br><br>&#x201c;No, go on, I&#x2019;ll be all right,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll wonder what&#x2019;s happened if I show up on my own.&#x201d;</p><h2>Too Useful to Sacrifice: Reconsidering George B. McClellan&#x2019;s Generalship in the Maryland Campaign from South Mountain to Antietam</h2><p>The importance of Robert E. Lee&#x2019;s first movement north of the Potomac River in September 1862 is difficult to overstate. After his string of successes in Virginia, a decisive Confederate victory in Maryland or Pennsylvania may well have spun the war in an entirely different direction. Why he and his Virginia army did not find success across the Potomac was due in large measure to the generalship of George B. McClellan, as Steven Stotelmyer ably demonstrates in Too Useful to Sacrifice: Reconsidering George B. McClellan&#x2019;s Generalship in the Maryland Campaign from South Mountain to Antietam.<br><br>Although typecast as the slow and overly cautious general who allowed Lee&#x2019;s battered army to escape, in fact, argues Stotelmyer, General McClellan deserves significant credit for defeating and turning back the South&#x2019;s most able general. He does so through five comprehensive chapters, each dedicated to a specific major issue of the campaign:<br><br>Fallacies Regarding the Lost Orders<br><br>All the Injury Possible: The Day between South Mountain and Antietam<br><br>Antietam: The Sequel to South Mountain<br><br>General John Pope at Antietam and the Politics behind the Myth of the Unused Reserves<br><br>Supplies and Demands: The Demise of General George B. McClellan<br><br>Was McClellan&#x2019;s response to the discovery of Lee&#x2019;s Lost Orders really as slow and inept as we have been led to believe? Although routinely dismissed as a small prelude to the main event at Antietam, was the fighting on South Mountain the real Confederate high tide in Maryland? Is the criticism leveled against McClellan for not rapidly pursuing Lee&#x2019;s army after the victory on South Mountain warranted? Did McClellan fail to make good use of his reserves in the bloody fighting on September 17? Finally, what is the real story behind McClellan&#x2019;s apparent &#x201c;failure&#x201d; to pursue the defeated Confederate army after Antietam, which triggered President Lincoln&#x2019;s frustration with him and resulted in his removal?<br><br>Utilizing extensive primary documents and with a keen appreciation for the infrastructure of the nineteenth century Maryland terrain, Stotelmyer deeply explores these long-held beliefs, revealing that often the influence of political considerations dictated military decision-making, and the deliberate actions of the Lincoln Administration behind McClellan&#x2019;s back resulted in bringing about many of the general&#x2019;s supposed shortcomings. As readers will soon discover, Lincoln did not need to continue searching for a capable commander; he already had one.</p><p>Steven R. Stotelmyer is a native of Hagerstown, Maryland. As a child he visited Antietam National Battlefield during many family picnics to that area. After a stint in the U.S. Navy he earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Frostburg State College and a Master of Arts from Hood College in Frederick, Maryland. He has worked as a teacher, surveyor, and civil engineer. Always interested in local history, especially South Mountain and Antietam, Mr. Stotelmyer was a founding member of the Central Maryland Heritage League in 1989. The league gained a modest amount of success in preserving some of the lands of the South Mountain Battlefield. From 1989 through 1994 Mr. Stotelmyer volunteered at the Antietam National Battlefield. In 1992 he published The Bivouacs of the Dead: The Story of Those Who Died at Antietam and South Mountain (Toomey Press, Baltimore, Maryland). From 2000 through 2005 Mr. Stotelmyer served as a part-time volunteer and historical consultant for the South Mountain State Battlefield.

The armies were small, but the stakes were high: control of the Southwest.

The sharp cries of the dying sliced through the cool early morning breeze. He could smell the acrid scents of both fear and hate from those who fought for their lives. He tasted the copper tang of the blood that had sunk into the ground.</p><p>It was the taste of blood that had awoken him.</p><p>He pressed his hands against the dry earth, flames licking at his bare skin, and tried forcing himself to his feet. He failed, his body screaming from the effort.</p><p>As his vision cleared he took a better look around. He was at the edge of a camp that was currently under siege. To his left, about fifty paces away, was a forest. It was dry and sparse and dying, but it offered more protection than his exposed position by the battleground.</p><p>Two men&#x2014;one short, one tall, both wearing red guard uniforms&#x2014;approached him, their swords drawn.</p><p>&#x201c;What do we have here?&#x201d; the short one said. &#x201c;A slave thinking he can escape?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m no slave.&#x201d; His voice cracked, and his throat felt as dry and brittle as the ground beneath him.</p><p>&#x201c;Forget your clothes somewhere, boy?&#x201d; the taller guard said.</p><p>He glanced down at his bare skin. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; the tall guard snapped. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t need clothes when you&#x2019;re dead. We&#x2019;ll make this quick.&#x201d;</p><p>The tall guard brought his blade down hard, but the young man managed to roll out of its way just in time. He pushed himself up to his feet, his legs as weak as a newborn colt&#x2019;s. Muscles screaming, he staggered toward the forest line.</p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time to chase after one runaway slave.&#x201d; The tall guard spoke loud enough to be heard above the noise of battle.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d rather have your throat cut by a rebel back there?&#x201d; the short guard said.</p><p>&#x201c;The king would prefer&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a damn what the king would prefer. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;</p><p>The forest was sparse, but the young man found a dry bush to hide behind. Its branches scratched his sensitive skin, but he stayed quiet and still. The guards ventured closer, whacking at the meager foliage with their swords.</p><p>He looked down at his hand and flexed. How long would it take before he got his strength back? He&#x2019;d already waited an eternity to be free.</p><p><i>I&#x2019;ve awakened before my time.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Maybe we should let him go,&#x201d; the shorter guard said, his previous bravado vanishing as fear entered his voice. &#x201c;Maybe he&#x2019;s the one who set the fire back there. He could be dangerous.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a coward. Strays can lead to more trouble, and more strays. I want his blood on my blade before we do anything else.&#x201d;</p><p>They drew closer, and he stumbled away from his hiding spot. As he fled, he tripped on the tangled roots of a large oak tree and fell, hard, to the ground. The guards swiftly found him, and he scrambled backward until he hit the tree&#x2019;s thick trunk.</p><p>&#x201c;You must feel so pathetic right now,&#x201d; the tall guard sneered. &#x201c;Hiding in a forest, naked, begging for your life.&#x201d;</p><p>He did feel pathetic. It was not an emotion he savored. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not begging.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll be begging soon enough. I promise.&#x201d; The guard gave him a smile that revealed just how much he enjoyed inflicting pain and suffering on those who were smaller and weaker than him.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; the tall guard asked his companion. &#x201c;Shall we take his hands before we kill him? Or his feet, so he can&#x2019;t try to run again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps we should bring him back to the dungeon to rot with the other captured rebels.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no fun.&#x201d; He touched the tip of his sword under the young man&#x2019;s chin, forcing him to meet the guard&#x2019;s cruel gaze. &#x201c;Who are you, boy? A slave who would bow to my whip while working on the king&#x2019;s road? Or are you a rebel who mistakenly believes he can change the destiny of this kingdom?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Neither.&#x201d; His lips were parched and his breathing was shallow.</p><p>The sword wrenched his head up higher, biting into his flesh. &#x201c;Then who are you?&#x201d; the guard asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; he began, very softly, &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. am a god.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A god, are you?&#x201d; The guard snorted with amusement. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how much do gods bleed?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait.&#x201d; The shorter one&#x2019;s voice was trembling. &#x201c;His eyes. Look at his eyes!&#x201d;</p><p>The tall guard withdrew his sword and took a shaky step back. &#x201c;What&#x2014;?&#x201d;</p><p>The young man unclenched his fist and looked down at his right hand. Etched into his palm was a triangle. Its edges glowed with the same blue light that now emanated from his eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a demon,&#x201d; the guard whispered. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I already told you what I am. But perhaps you weren&#x2019;t listening.&#x201d; He pushed himself back up to his feet. The symbol on his hand grew brighter as he held it out to the guard. &#x201c;Shall I show you instead?&#x201d;</p><p>Suddenly, a single flame appeared on the dry ground in front of them. It flickered, then shot up and licked the guard&#x2019;s boot. In a thin line, the fire snaked around his ankle and then began to wrap itself around his calf and thigh. He batted at it and touched it with his hand, which only made it grow even mightier. It clawed at his wrist and writhed around his arm like a bracelet.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; The guard reached out for assistance, but his short friend staggered away from him.</p><p>&#x201c;Does it hurt yet?&#x201d; the young man asked calmly. &#x201c;If not, just give it a moment. It will.&#x201d;</p><p>The flames spread until the guard&#x2019;s legs, torso, arms, and, lastly, his confused, fearful face were all ablaze. The fire then turned from orange to blue.</p><p>That was when the guard began to scream.</p><p>The other guard stood frozen in place with horror, watching as his friend blazed like a torch in the early morning light. Suddenly, the flames grew wilder, leaping up thirty feet into the air and taking the guard with them. Finally, the guard stopped screaming.</p><p>Like a glass sculpture landing on a marble floor, his body shattered into a million pieces.</p><p>He turned to the guard he&#x2019;d spared. &#x201c;Run.&#x201d;</p><p>Eyes wide with terror, the guard turned and fled.</p><p>With what little energy he&#x2019;d had now depleted, he collapsed to his knees. The symbol on his hand faded to only a trace, a mark resembling an old scar. The ground still smoldered where the tall guard once stood, although there was nothing left of him but an already fading memory.</p><p>Finally, his pain eased. His thoughts became clear, and a small smile lifted the corners of his mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Only the beginning,&#x201d; he whispered as darkness rose up to cover him like a thick cloak.</p><p>Soon he&#x2019;d make them all burn for what they&#x2019;d done to him.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>JONAS</p><p>PAELSIA</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a bad feeling about this.&#x201d;</p><p>Rufus&#x2019;s voice was as distracting as a persistent horsefly. Jonas sent his fellow rebel an impatient look through the darkness.</p><p> &#x201c;Really. Which part?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All of it. We need to get out of here while we still can.&#x201d; Rufus craned his thick, sweaty neck to scan the line of trees surrounding them, guided only by the light of a single torch they&#x2019;d shoved into the loose soil. &#x201c;He said his friends would be here any moment.&#x201d;</p><p>He was referring to the Limerian guard they&#x2019;d captured after discovering him straying too close to the edge of the forest. He was currently tied to a tree, unconscious.</p><p>But an unconscious guard wasn&#x2019;t any use to Jonas. He needed answers. Though he had to agree with Rufus on one thing: They were swiftly running out of time, especially since they were so close to a village infested with the king&#x2019;s red-uniformed minions.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course he said that,&#x201d; Jonas said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called a bluff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; Rufus raised his brows, as though this hadn&#x2019;t occurred to him. &#x201c;You think?&#x201d;</p><p>A week had passed since the rebel attack on the road camp in eastern Paelsia beneath the Forbidden Mountains. A week since Jonas&#x2019;s most recent plan to defeat King Gaius had gone horribly awry.</p><p>Forty-seven rebels had descended upon the sleepy campground at dawn in an attempt to seize the road engineer, Xanthus, and the Limerian heir, Prince Magnus, to hold as hostages against King Gaius.</p><p>They&#x2019;d failed. A flash fire of strange blue flames had burned everything in its path, and Jonas had barely escaped with his life.</p><p>Rufus had been the only other rebel waiting at the meeting spot later that morning. Jonas had found him standing there with tears streaming down his dirty face, trembling with fear and rambling about fire magic and witches and sorcery.</p><p>Only two of forty-seven had been accounted for. It was a crushing defeat in far too many ways, and if Jonas thought about it too much he could barely see straight, could barely function beyond his guilt and grief.</p><p>His plan. His orders.</p><p>His fault.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Desperately trying to push aside his own pain, Jonas had immediately begun to gather information about other potential survivors&#x2014;anyone who&#x2019;d been captured alive and carted away.</p><p>The guard they&#x2019;d found wore red. He was the enemy.</p><p>He had to have answers that could help Jonas. He <i>had</i> to.</p><p>Finally, the guard opened his eyes. He was older than most other guards, with graying hair at his temples. He also walked with a limp, which had made him easier to catch.</p><p>&#x201c;You&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know you,&#x201d; the guard muttered, his eyes glittering in the meager torchlight. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Jonas Agallon, the murderer of Queen Althea.&#x201d;</p><p>He threw these words like weapons. Jonas flinched inwardly, but showed no sign that the most heinous lie ever told about him caused him injury.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t kill the queen,&#x201d; he growled.</p><p>&#x201c;Why would I believe you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ignoring Rufus&#x2019;s squeamish expression, Jonas walked a slow circle around the restrained guard, trying to determine how difficult it would be to get him talking.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to believe me.&#x201d; He leaned closer. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going to answer some questions for me now.&#x201d;</p><p>The guard&#x2019;s upper lip drew back from his yellow teeth in a snarl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;d expected that, of course. Nothing was ever easy.</p><p>Jonas pulled the jeweled dagger from the sheath on his belt. Its wavy silver blade caught the moonlight, immediately drawing the guard&#x2019;s attention.</p><p>It was the very same weapon that had taken his older brother from this world. That vain and pompous Auranian lord had left it behind, embedded in Tomas&#x2019;s throat. This dagger had become a symbol to Jonas, representing the line he&#x2019;d drawn in the sand between his past as the son of a poor wine seller who toiled every day in his father&#x2019;s vineyard, and his future as a rebel, certain he would die fighting for what he believed in most: freedom from tyranny for those he loved. And freedom from tyranny for those he&#x2019;d never even met before.</p><p>A world without King Gaius&#x2019;s hands wringing the necks of the weak and powerless.</p><p>Jonas pressed the dagger to the guard&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;I suggest you answer my questions if you don&#x2019;t want your blood to be spilled tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do more than bleed if the king learns I&#x2019;ve done anything to help you.&#x201d;</p><p>He was right&#x2014;the crime of assisting a rebel would undoubtedly lead to torture or execution. Likely both. Though the king enjoyed making pretty speeches about the united kingdoms of Mytica with a broad smile on his handsome face, he did not receive the nickname &#x201c;the King of Blood&#x201d; by being fair and kind.</p><p>&#x201c;One week ago, there was a rebel attack on the road camp east of here. Do you know about it?&#x201d;</p><p>The guard held his gaze unflinchingly. &#x201c;I heard the rebels died screaming.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas&#x2019;s heart twisted. He clenched his hand into a fist, aching to make this guard suffer. A tremor shook through him at the memory of last week, but he tried to focus on the task at hand. <i>Only</i> the task at hand.</p><p>Rufus raked his fingers through his messy hair and paced back and forth in nervous lines.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to know if any rebels were captured alive,&#x201d; Jonas continued. &#x201c;And I need to know where the king is holding them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe you. Start talking or I promise I&#x2019;ll cut your throat.&#x201d;</p><p>There was no fear in the guard&#x2019;s eyes, only a mocking edge. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard so many fearsome rumors about the leader of the Paelsian rebels. But rumors aren&#x2019;t facts, aren&#x2019;t they? Perhaps you&#x2019;re nothing more than a Paelsian peasant boy&#x2014;not nearly ruthless enough to kill someone in cold blood. Not even your enemy.&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas had killed before&#x2014;enough that he&#x2019;d lost count. In a foolish war that tricked Paelsians into allying with Limerians against Auranos. In the battle at the road camp. He&#x2019;d only fought in order to strike down his enemies and bring justice to his friends, his family, and his fellow Paelsians. And to protect himself.</p><p>There had been meaning behind those deaths, even if that meaning had been jumbled and unclear. He fought for a purpose, believed in something.</p><p>He took no pleasure in taking lives, and he hoped he never would.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Jonas. He&#x2019;s useless,&#x201d; Rufus said, his voice twisting with anxiety. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go while we still can.&#x201d;</p><p>But Jonas didn&#x2019;t budge, and forced himself to focus on the task at hand. He hadn&#x2019;t come this far to give up now. &#x201c;There was a girl who fought in the battle named Lysandra Barbas. I need to know if she&#x2019;s still alive.&#x201d;</p><p>The guard&#x2019;s lips twisted into a cruel grin. &#x201c;Ah, so this is why you&#x2019;re so driven for answers. This girl belongs to you?&#x201d;</p><p>It took Jonas a moment to understand his meaning. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s like a sister to me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jonas,&#x201d; Rufus whined. &#x201c;Lysandra&#x2019;s gone. She&#x2019;s dead. Obsessing about her is only going to get us killed, too!&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas cast a glare at Rufus that made the boy wince, but it was enough to make him shut his stupid mouth.</p><p>Lysandra wasn&#x2019;t dead. She couldn&#x2019;t be. She was an incredible fighter&#x2014;skilled with a bow and arrow like no one Jonas had witnessed before.</p><p>Lysandra had also been opinionated, demanding, and incredibly annoying from the first moment he&#x2019;d first met her. And if she still lived, Jonas would do anything to find her.</p><p>He needed her&#x2014;both as a fellow rebel and as a friend.</p><p>&#x201c;You must know <i>something</i>.&#x201d; Jonas pressed the dagger closer to the guard&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;re going to tell me right now.&#x201d;</p><p>No matter how high the stakes, Jonas would never give up. Not until his very last breath.</p><p>&#x201c;This girl&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&#x201d; the guard said through clenched teeth, &#x201c;is she worth your life?&#x201d;</p><p>Jonas didn&#x2019;t have to think twice. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ve no doubt she&#x2019;s every bit as dead as you are.&#x201d; The guard smirked despite the trickle of blood now sliding down his throat. He raised his voice. &#x201c;Over here!&#x201d;</p><p>A crunch of dirt and a snap of branches were all that warned of the half-dozen Limerian guards that now burst into the small forest clearing. Their swords were drawn, and two of them carried torches.</p><p>&#x201c;Drop your weapons, rebel!&#x201d;</p><p>Rufus swung his fist at an approaching guard, but missed by a mile. &#x201c;Jonas, do something!&#x201d;</p><p> Rather than drop the dagger, Jonas sheathed it, then drew the sword he&#x2019;d stolen from Prince Magnus last week before Jonas had managed to escape. He hoisted it up in time to block a blow aimed directly for his chest. Rufus tried to fight back, punching and kicking, bu...</p></p><h2>The Lark and the Wren (Bardic Voices, Book 1)</h2><p>Young, brash, and impulsive, Rune backs up a brag by ascending Skull Hill to play fiddle for the malevolent spirit that resides there, striking a bargain with the ghost to surrender her soul if he tires of her playing before sunrise.</p><p>YA-- The tale of a daring adventuress whose heart and spirit seek expertise in music, but whose experiences lead to : knowledge of life itself.

Jackson made to survive the Portland, Oregon of his youth.</b><br><br>This dynamic book explores gangs and guns, near-death experiences, sex work, masculinity, composite fathers, the concept of &#x201c;hustle,&#x201d; and the destructive power of addiction&#x2014;all framed within the story of Jackson, his family, and his community. Lauded for its breathtaking pace, its tender portrayals, its stark candor, and its luminous style, <i>Survival Math </i>reveals on every page the searching intellect and originality of its author. The primary narrative, focused on understanding the antecedents of Jackson&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s experience, is complemented by poems composed from historical American documents as well as survivor files, which feature photographs and riveting short narratives of several of Jackson&#x2019;s male relatives. The sum of <i>Survival Math</i>&#x2019;s parts is a highly original whole, one that reflects on the exigencies&#x2014;over generations&#x2014;that have shaped the lives of so many disenfranchised Americans. As essential as it is beautiful, as real as it is artful, Mitchell S. Jackson&#x2019;s nonfiction debut is a singular achievement, not to be missed.</p><p>Mitchell S.

For bread to live. For bread to leave. The day in question, I got a phone call from someone who, for the love (and just maybe his liberty), I&#x2019;ll call Brother A. Brother A called me to plead a ride to his apartment in the burbs to sweep for dope after his dope-dealing roommate, a dude who&#x2019;d already done a nickel in the pen on a drug charge (which, by the way, is not judgment, but context), had just got knocked by the Feds. Brother A explained he needed the ride because his main squeeze had wrecked his Jeep, and he couldn&#x2019;t think of anyone more fitting than me, of all people on God&#x2019;s verdant earth, me, to be the one to shuttle him.<br> <br>Heeeeeelllll no! That should have been my answer. But that was not my answer. My answer tugged me out of my job at the end of my shift and into the forest-evergreen Lexus I&#x2019;d bought in the bygone unblessed days when I sold more than weed. It sent me bolting out of my job and into my ride to swoop Brother A from someplace close and hit Highway 26 with most dubious sense.<br> <br>Guessing now is as good a time as ever to mention that this was the age during which I might&#x2019;ve been selling weed&#x2014;twenty sacks, eighths, half and whole zips, and in the most blessed of times, half and whole pounds. Selling chronic, stacking newspapers, and throwing parties because evermore this brother, a brother, every brother should diversify his hustle. No mights or maybes to that.<br> <br>Memories from that age, hypothetical and otherwise, seldom feature date stamps, but I can assure you this incident occurred May 2002 AD, which I know for truth because one of my homeboys and me had just thrown a well-attended Memorial Day shindig, and between my cut of the door and profits from the weed I may have been selling, I had a knot of bills in my inky work jeans&#x2014;which accounts for why at the time I was feeling at least extra medium about myself. Brother A and I traded lightweight banter en route, and before I knew it, we&#x2019;d reached his apartment complex, grounds of such expanse, there was plenty of time for my pulse to cease between the moment I pulled into the lot and when I found a place to park my tree-colored ride. Can&#x2019;t speak for Brother A, but in that interstice of arriving and stepping a wary foot out of my ride, I had visions of police swarming us from bushes and vans, seizing discomfited me, slamming my cheek against unforgiving asphalt, and KABLOWING! on cuffs.<br> <br>We did not&#x2014;word to Yahweh&#x2014;get ambushed that moment. We hustled past a passel of blithe youngsters and mounted a flight and a flight and a flight of stairs and stood at the threshold of his apartment door (my heart athunder) and asked each other again and for the last time if we should enter, which, inhale, of course we did.<br> <br>Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.<br> <br>No one was inside. Good sense says I should&#x2019;ve left Brother A to brave his fate alone but instead I sat on the living room couch while he proceeded to sweep his roommate&#x2019;s room and the hall closets and every place else he could think to look. He didn&#x2019;t find any meth, but he did find cooking supplies and utensils, which he took straight to the kitchen to scrub and scour. Meanwhile, I sat on the living room couch doing my best impression of ecclesiastical calm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man, I can&#x2019;t believe we was so spooked,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, we silly,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Like the police worried about us.&#x201d;<br> <br>He paused and motioned at me. &#x201c;Shit, I almost forgot. Come check this out.&#x201d; This is when Brother A led me to his bedroom, pulled a pound of weed from a stash spot, and flaunted a sample. &#x201c;This some killer,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Smell it.&#x201d; What may or may not have happened next now seems like an act of intercession bestowed by my great-grandmama or some other churchgoing kin. That act, amen, was using my shirt to grab the plastic bag and inspect a few fluffy, sticky, fragrant stems. I put the weed back and mentioned how fast it would sell and may or may not have asked him if he could cop for me.<br> <br>He and I strolled back into the living room&#x2014;me to the couch and Brother A back to washing possible evidence down the drain. Seconds later I heard footsteps on the stairs. PATTER, PATTER, PATTER! Heard them and said to myself, Here come those kids. PATTER, PATTER, PATTER, PATTER! Thought to myself, Wow, them some heavy-footed-ass kids. PATTER, PATTER, PATTER, PATTER, PATTER! Mused, Boy, there must be more kids than I thought. That&#x2019;s when Brother A hustled over to the peephole, said, &#x201c;Oh, shit! POLICE!&#x201d; and broke for his bedroom.<br> <br>Before I could move, a mob of police, sheriff, and DEA bum-rushed into Brother A&#x2019;s crib. &#x201c;Get on the ground! Get on the ground now! Keep your hands where we can see them! Get down! Get down!&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh. My. God! I thought, and dropped to my knees then prostrate.<br> <br>Brother A darted into the living room and ranted, &#x201c;Let me see your warrant. Let me see your warrant,&#x201d; and in an instant, they spun him face to wall and cuffed him. One officer jerked me off the carpet and asked if I was carrying drugs, if I had anything in my pockets that might cut or poke him. No, I said. And he emptied my pockets, beheld my cell phone and pager and the knot of cash&#x2014;most of which, let me remind you, I&#x2019;d made from my Memorial Day shindig and some of which I may or may not have made from serving fat sacks of chronic. More officers appeared, one of them tugging a stout German shepherd. That same officer informed me that if the dog hit on anything from my pockets, he&#x2019;d confiscate it.<br> <br>He let his canine loose. It sniffed my wrinkled wad of bills and barked.<br> <br>Ain&#x2019;t that a bitch! I thought.<br> <br>The next moment, an officer bopped into the apartment carrying a bag of weed that could&#x2019;ve been a motherfucking facsimile of the one Brother A may or may not have flaunted to me thrumming pulses ago. The officer announced he&#x2019;d found it in a sprinkler outside, asked which one of us it belonged to, and Brother A and me bucked our eyes at each other and damn near shook our heads off our necks. &#x201c;Huh, what&#x2019;s that? We ain&#x2019;t never seen that in life!&#x201d; we said.<br> <br>He crooked his lip and warned if he found either of our fingerprints on the bag he&#x2019;d charge us.<br> <br>The officer who searched me marched me into a bedroom and ordered me ass to floor and back to wall while he stood.<br> <br>He asked me if I knew Brother A&#x2019;s roommate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know him well, more like &#x2018;Hi&#x2019; and &#x2018;Bye,&#x2019; but yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I met him.&#x201d;<br> <br>He asked if I knew Brother A&#x2019;s roommate sold dope.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wow, he did?!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I had no idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>He asked if I&#x2019;d ever been to jail or prison.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, uh&#x2014;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;One time. Just the one time, though.&#x201d;<br> <br>He asked me what I&#x2019;d gone to jail for.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, uh, um, uh, um&#x2014;for selling drugs,&#x201d; I said, and the rest fell out my mouth: &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not what you think. I don&#x2019;t do it anymore, Officer. I&#x2019;m going to be a writer. Officer, you got to believe me. I&#x2019;m moving to New York in a few months for grad school. This looks bad, Officer, but it&#x2019;s not how it looks. My word, Officer. Just a few months till I leave,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Please, Officer, please. You&#x2019;ve got to let me go!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let my people go,&#x201d; Moses and Aaron told the pharaoh of Egypt at the advent of history&#x2019;s most famous exodus. The Hebrew name for Egypt, where Moses&#x2019;s people began their journey, is Mitzrayim. For Jews, Mitzrayim denotes a place, but it also describes a liberation from psychological limits, the emotional journeys that one experiences all life long. My Mitzrayim demanded envisioning a world beyond one that in many ways had been circumscribed; it required believing I could thrive outside where I was born.<br> <br>The west exodus of my tribe&#x2014;the Jacksons&#x2014;began in the 1950s, in the Mitzrayim that was Montgomery, Alabama. It could begin with my great-grandparents&#x2014;Edith &#x201c;Mama Edie&#x201d; Larkin Jackson and Samuel &#x201c;Bubba&#x201d; Andrew Jackson Sr.&#x2014;at a mass meeting of the Montgomery Improvement Association, the couple among dozens of spirited negroes filling the hard wooden pews of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. My great-grandmama styling in a floral-print knee-length dress and cat-eye specs, and my great-grandaddy decked out in a dark worsted-wool suit and wing-tips polished reflective. Picture the whole room hand in hand and swaying as they sing, &#x201c;Gooooo down, Moses / Waaaay down in Egypt&#x2019;s land / Tell old Pharaoh / Let my people gooooo.&#x201d; The room raises its voice till it shakes the stained-glass windows, then falls hush as MLK, the disciple, prophet, future martyr (go ahead, choose) of an age takes the pulpit in one of his tailored blue suits and a skinny tie and sermonizes on the plans of a Montgomery Transit Authority boycott that, in the days of the Old Testament, might&#x2019;ve summoned thunder and lightning. In that meeting or one not too long after, MLK asks for volunteers to carpool members of the boycott and Mama Edie nudges Bubba to raise his hand.<br> <br>Per familial lore, Mama Edie&#x2019;s mama, Carrie Larkin AKA my great-great-grandmother, was a Montgomery bootlegger par excellence, a savvy woman who invested her ample profits in square miles of terra firma and a restaurant. My great-great-grandmother bore her husband eight children&#x2014;four girls and four boys&#x2014;and of that brood, my great-grandmother Edith &#x201c;Edie&#x201d; Larkin was the third girl, born in 1916. Edie was beautiful and smart and the daughter most liable to test the house rules. Mama Edie&#x2019;s enterprising mother paid her way through what was then Alabama State College&#x2014;she did the same for all her daughters. Mama Edie, like every one of her sisters, became a schoolteacher and lived a comfortable life for the time and place thanks to what seemed like inexhaustible deals. They sold tract after tract of family land and divvied up the dividends among their tribe.<br> <br>Unlike the Larkins, the Jacksons were not a tribe of wealth. My great-grandfather Samuel &#x201c;Bubba&#x201d; Andrew Jackson Sr. was born in 1908 in Ada, Alabama, a place so small they call it an unincorporated community of Montgomery County. Bubba was the second to the youngest of his parents&#x2019; brood of four, and despite being ambitious and hardworking and smart with a miraculous recall for dates, times, and facts, he was forced, like many of his time, to cease his formal schooling before he reached high school. Young Bubba married his first wife, Lillian Dora Arrington, sired his lone biological son, Samuel Andrew Jackson Jr.&#x2014;my grandfather&#x2014;and supported his wife and baby boy by running a shoe shop and selling Watkins products door-to-door. Bubba&#x2019;s first wife died of a food-related illness a few years into their marriage, and he met Mama Edie soon after, married for the second time in 1942, and moved to a trailer on Larkin land in a part of town known as the Prairie.<br> <br>The English word exodus is derived from the Greek ex, which means &#x201c;out,&#x201d; and hodos, meaning &#x201c;way&#x201d;&#x2014;the way out. A year or so before MLK moved from Montgomery to Atlanta and became assistant pastor to his father at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Mama Edie and Bubba made their way out of Alabama to a land that, if not one of milk and honey, promised to be a place less bitter in their mouths. Their migration to Portland began, so one story goes, in the summer of &#x2019;58 or &#x2019;59. Mama Edie flew to Portland to visit her sister-in-law and felt so passionate about the city that she phoned Bubba and persuaded him to pack their things and move. Per another story, Mama Edie moved out to Portland with the express intent of helping to integrate the Portland Public Schools, a district that announced soon after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling that it would &#x201c;take no action regarding segregation,&#x201d; despite blacks being relegated almost exclusively to the underfunded and subpar schools in the Albina district. In my mind, the true catalyst for my great-grandparents&#x2019; migration was somewhere between the stories of love for a new city and wanting to transform it.<br> <br>In addition to those stories, these facts: Mama Edie and Bubba moved into a house on North Missouri Ave in the Albina district. My activist and missionary-minded great-grandmother got a job teaching at Boise-Eliot Elementary School, a position that began her long career as a beloved Portland teacher. In the City of Roses, Bubba earned his living first as a shoe repairman and, until retirement, as a hospital custodian. In 1960, not too long after they moved to their promised land, they persuaded Sam Jackson Jr., the biological son Bubba fathered by his first wife, to move from Alabama with his wife and four young children&#x2014;Sam III, George, Anthony, and my mother, Lillie. Meanwhile my great-grands lived sans significant marital quarrels and as loving and supportive friends in plural. They also became active members of St. Andrew Catholic Church and continued their political activism. If there was an asterisk to their marriage, it was the fact that they couldn&#x2019;t conceive a child, an issue they addressed by adopting three children between the late 1950s and the 1960s: Ezekiel and Essie as toddlers and later a grade-school-aged boy named John. Mama Edie and Bubba&#x2019;s adopted children were raised with my mother and her brothers as siblings, as they were close in age and all lived at times under the same roof.<br> <br>In the summer of 1975, my mother bore Mama Edie and Bubba their first great-grandchild: me. The pair were out of town that August I was born, attending to Mama Edie&#x2019;s niece who had a baby due a month before me. My great-grands traveled back to Portland in September and my mother resumed, with me this time, living with them in a white house the size of a small palace that stands on the corner of Sixth and Mason.<br> <br>The House on Sixth Avenue.<br> <br>Home.<br> <br>Let me tell you about the old cherry tree in the front yard of that home, whose stingy yield we&#x2019;d pluck before it ripened, about the plum and pear trees and blackberry bushes in the backyard, about the garden that Mama Edie tended with love. A hex-web fence surrounded the whole yard, and I&#x2019;d get scolded for playing on it. If Mama Edie, the family&#x2019;s most austere disciplinarian, chided me more than a few times (which most times meant any more than once), I was commanded to fetch a switch, and if I returned with one too flimsy, I&#x2019;d be sent for another ad infinitum.<br> <br>Most folks entered our home through the thick wooden door inset with a large oval glass draped by thin red curtains, an entrance that opened onto a living room with embroidered green couches wrapped in hard plastic and a glass-top coffee table encasing ruby-handled swords. My great-grands had bedazzled the dining room with a chandelier made of a billion oblong crystals and a veneered table that could seat the Last Supper, not to mention a paradise of potted plants lining the window ledges. The kitchen was pasted with a pattern of pots and pans&#x2014;wallpaper that bubbled in spots and peeled away from the moldings&#x2014;and some mornings I&#x2019;d open the kitchen cabinet to search for cornflakes and see a mouse skittering out of sight or else a trail of tiny rodent turds. Mama Edie hobbied on the piano and kept a scratched black upright in a nook that was also decked with earth-toned tweed couches. My great-grands kept their bedroom door locked, but some nights they&#x2019;d let me inside to sprawl across the bed whi...</p><h2>Climate Confusion: How Global Warming Hysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies That Hurt the Poor</h2><p>The current frenzy over global warming has galvanized the public and cost taxpayers billons of dollars in federal expenditures for climate research. It has spawned Hollywood blockbusters and inspired major political movements. It has given a higher calling to celebrities and built a lucrative industry for scores of eager scientists. In short, ending climate change has become a national crusade. And yet, despite this dominant and sprawling campaign, the facts behind global warming remain as confounding as ever. In Climate Confusion, distinguished climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer observes that our obsession with global warming has only clouded the issue. Forsaking blindingly technical statistics and doomsday scenarios, Dr. Spencer explains in simple terms how the climate system really works, why man&#39;s role in global warming is more myth than science, and how the global warming hype has corrupted Washington and the scientific community. The reasons, Spencer explains, are numerous: biases in governmental funding of scientific research, our misconceptions about science and basic economics, even our religious beliefs and worldviews. From Al Gore to Leonardo DiCaprio, the climate change industry has given a platform to leading figures from all walks of life, as pandering politicians, demagogues and biased scientists forge a self-interested movement whose proposed policy initiatives could ultimately devastate the economies of those developing countries they purport to aid. Climate Confusion is a much needed wake up call for all of us on planet earth. Dr. Spencer&#39;s clear-eyed approach, combined with his sharp wit and intellect, brings transparency and levity to the issue of global warming as he takes on wrong-headed attitudes and misguided beliefs that have led to our state of panic. Climate Confusion lifts the shroud of mystery that has hovered here for far too long and offers an end to this frenzy of misinformation in our lives. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.</p><p>I wrote Climate Confusion for several reasons. In contrast to other works, I wanted it to be an entertaining and easily understood primer on how weather and climate works, showing why manmade global warming is unlikely to be a serious problem for humanity. Furthermore, I wanted to explore the political, philosophical, and religious underpinnings of beliefs in catastrophic global warming, helping the reader to better appreciate why scientific research in this area has become tainted and untrustworthy. Finally, and possibly most importantly, by using basic economic concepts I wanted to counter currently proposed policy &#34;solutions&#34; to global warming that will have devastating effects on the world&#39;s poor.Climate Confusion is the best book length treatment of global warming science that is available to the literate citizen. The title says it all. Spencer explains the broad agreement over the existence of some climate change and the existence of some human role, but he also explains why these have little to do with the implausible and overheated projections of environmental disaster. The author thus cuts through all the rhetorical brickbats of `denialism' and `salvationism' to allow the citizen to reach rational conclusions. Despite a light touch, Spencer does not pull punches when it comes to unclothing the moral pretenses of many in the environmental movement - pretenses often disguising some truly immoral agendas. <p>Richard S. Lindzen, Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Atmospheric Sciences </p><p>"An outstanding discussion of the many scientific, political and religious problems associated with the acceptance that humans are the primary cause of global warming. A must read for anyone wanting a full and balanced understanding of the global warming debate." </p><p>William M. Gray, Professor Emeritus, Department of Atmospheric Science, Colorado State University </p><p>Roy Spencer's "Climate Confusion" is needed to put the global warming hysteria in its rightful place. He has done a yeoman's job in making the issue understandable and accessible to the general public without a sacrifice in the rigor of his arguments. </p><p>Walter E. Williams John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of Economics George Mason University </p><p>If you have an interest in global warming, but are intimidated by equations and scientific terminology, this book is for you. The author explores the philosophy of global warming (and cooling), examines the limitations of global numerical models for which all alarmist statements are based, and discusses the economics of alternative actions that might be pursued. This book is an excellent read!

It is also a book about place. Growing up in a small prairie city, where the local heroes were hockey players and curlers, Lorna Crozier never once dreamed of becoming a writer. Nonetheless, the grace, wisdom, and wit of her poetry have won her international acclaim. In this marvellous volume of recollections, she charts the geography that has shaped her character and her sense of home. <br><br>Crozier vividly depicts her hometown of Swift Current, with its one main street, its two high schools-the one on top of the hill was for the wealthy kids - and its three beer parlours, where her father spent most of his evenings. She captures crystal moments from her childhood - delivering newspapers with her brother in the blue-snow light of a winter morning, planting potatoes under a pale full moon, enjoying an illicit night swim in the town's public pool. She writes unflinchingly, too, about the grief and shame caused by poverty and alcoholism. At the heart of the book is Crozier's fierce love for her mother, Peggy, her no-nonsense champion and moral guide.<br><br>The people in these pages are drawn simply, without adornment, as befits the landscape in which they live. Interspersed with the narratives of daily life - sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking - are prose poems evoking the elements. These "first causes" - dust, light, rain, wind, snow-take on mythical qualities in Crozier's sure hands, imparting ancient knowledge about the prairie grasslands and their effect on those who have put down stakes there. <br><br>Rich in detail, generous in spirit, this unconventional memoir pays tribute to life's mysteries, secrets, and surprises. Lorna Crozier approaches the past with a tactile, arms-wide-open sense of discovery. Calling on the ghosts of ancestors and the power of memory, she has traced her beginnings with a poet's precision and an open heart.</p><p><p><b>Lorna Crozier</b> has received numerous awards, including the Governor General's Award, for her fifteen books of poetry, which include <i>The Blue Hour of the Day</i>, <i>What the Living Won't Let Go</i>, <i>Everything Arrives at the Light,</i> and <i>Inventing the Hawk</i>.

But why would anyone want to preserve an animal, and what is this animal-thing now? Rachel Poliquin suggests that taxidermy is entwined with the enduring human longing to find meaning with and within the natural world. Her study draws out the longings at the heart of taxidermy&#x2014;the longing for wonder, beauty, spectacle, order, narrative, allegory, and remembrance. In so doing, <em>The Breathless Zoo</em> explores the animal spectacles desired by particular communities, human assumptions of superiority, the yearnings for hidden truths within animal form, and the loneliness and longing that haunt our strange human existence, being both within and apart from nature.</p></p><p><p>Rachel Poliquin is a writer and curator engaged with the cultural and poetic history of the natural world. She has curated taxidermy exhibits for the Museum of Vancouver and the Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia. Poliquin is the author of www.ravishingbeasts.com, a website dedicated to exploring the cultural history of taxidermy.</p>&#x201c;I have long been a fan of Rachel Poliquin&#x2019;s otherworldly online museum, www.ravishingbeasts.com, but after reading <i>The Breathless Zoo</i> I know just what she means when she says that all taxidermy, like storytelling, is &#x2018;deeply marked by human longing.&#x2019; I am already longing to read <i>The Breathless Zoo</i> again.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Jay Kirk, University of Pennsylvania, author of <i>Kingdom Under Glass</i><br><br>&#x201c;With <i>The Breathless Zoo,</i> Rachel Poliquin has made a major contribution to the blossoming field of animal studies. This book is the new benchmark on the place of taxidermy in the social history of art, science, and popular culture. Marvelous, rigorous, and extensively well researched, the work is also refreshingly pleasurable to read. Throughout, Poliquin explores the complex questions around the rich cultural texture of taxidermy. And unlike other works on the topic, <i>The Breathless Zoo</i> examines not only what taxidermy is but also what it means. For those of us engaged in thinking about animals, this is the book on the culture of taxidermy we have long awaited&#x2014;a book of great innovation that slices through the history of science, blood sports, and art.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Mark Dion<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Breathless Zoo</i> is an intriguing and poetic meditation on an unlikely subject: stuffed animals in European museums that seem so familiar and so intellectually musty. Rachel Poliquin teases out of them not just a typological order but also a human longing for beauty and wonder, story and allegory. In the dead specimens she finds immortality; in their stasis, movement across the world. The result is a rich panorama of human ideas and desires.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Marina Belozerskaya, author of <i>The Medici Giraffe</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Breathless Zoo</i> is the book that the subject of taxidermy has long deserved. Full of provocative opinions, beautifully expressed, it is a subtle and thoroughly engaging exploration of the difficult question posed by all present-day encounters with taxidermy: &#x2018;What is this animal-thing now?&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Steve Baker, author of <i>The Postmodern Animal</i><br><br>&#x201c;What do Roy Rogers&#x2019; horse, Trigger, Jumbo the Barnum and Bailey circus elephant, and Dolly the cloned sheep all have in common? They were all stuffed. Or, to be more precise, they have all been given life-after-death through the magic of taxidermy. They share this fate with cats dressed in crinolines, ice-skating hedgehogs and gophers doing, well, all manner of things. And with hummingbirds in nineteenth-century glass cases at London&#x2019;s Natural History Museum and zebras on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. What is it that propels human beings to stuff the dead bodies of other animals or birds? According to the author of a new book on the subject, taxidermy is about longing&#x2014;it is a way of staving off the inevitable, of holding onto the past. Vancouver writer and curator Rachel Poliquin presents a delightfully thorough account of a practice that spans centuries.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Michael Enright, <i>CBC Sunday Edition</i><br><br>&#x201c;A wealth of well-chosen illustrations, anecdotes, and deft readings of individual pieces of taxidermy make <i>The Breathless Zoo</i> a rich study that will appeal to a variety of readers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Anjuli Raza Kolb, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;Rachel Poliquin's <i>The Breathless Zoo: Taxidermy and the Cultures of Longing</i> unearths much of the rich history and technology of stretching and mounting skins, from seventeenth-century European explorers to contemporary collectors and practitioners, along the way packing in a large number of observations. . . . With a detailed index and ample notes, this examination of taxidermy is a useful resource that can support cross-disciplinary research in art, cultural studies, and animal studies.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Richard Graham, <i>Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;It comes as no wonder that <i>The New York Times </i>included Rachel Poliquin&#x2019;s <i>The Breathless Zoo </i>among its best coffee table books of 2012, calling it one among a privileged selection of titles that &#x2018;make an impression.&#x2019;</p><p>Along with a rigorously researched and written text, <i>The Breathless Zoo </i>offers up an aesthetically enviable book design, which includes a collection of sumptuously colored images that often amaze, as frequently unnerve, but always leave the curious mind wanting more.

Yates III, the first volume in the Reformation Anglicanism Essential Library examines the rich heritage of the Anglican Communion, introducing its foundational doctrines rooted in the <em>solas</em> of the Reformation and drawing out the implications of this tradition for life and ministry in the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><p>&#x201c;In light of the current crises of the Anglican Communion, this study of the origins of Reformation Anglicanism is particularly timely. The authors remind us why the Church of England adopted the confessional formularies that have characterized it since the sixteenth century and examine the relevance of these to the modern situation at home and abroad. Everyone with an interest in Anglicanism will benefit from looking afresh at its core principles, and the authors of this volume have done their best to demonstrate how those principles are still meaningful and relevant today.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gerald Bray, </strong>Research Professor of Divinity, History, and Doctrine, Beeson Divinity School;&nbsp;author, <em>God Is Love </em>and <em>God Has Spoken</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book sketches some of the Church of England&#x2019;s complex history from early beginnings to the shape of the present worldwide denomination, now about eighty million strong.

Meanwhile, another man, AJ, has been thrown out of the club, and he&#x2019;s drunk and angry and lonely.

He lives with his family north of Boston.Dan John Miller is one of those narrators willing to stay in the background and allow the storyteller to take the spotlight. That is not a criticism, only an observation of his technique here. It&#39;s hard to argue with Miller&#39;s choice in the case of this novel, which rotates among a cast of characters, each seemingly doomed in some way. Most of the action takes place in a Florida strip club, where one of the main characters, a dancer named Spring, works. The other characters are a resentful, estranged husband, who will make a disastrous mistake, and a Saudi, who two days later will participate in the attacks of 9/11. Miller capably handles the accents during the occasional dialogue but is otherwise an understated performer.

But Cardassia's struggle to remake itself&#x2014;from the fledgling democracy backed by Elim Garak to the people's rediscovery of their own spiritual past&#x2014;is not without opposition, as the outside efforts to help rebuild its civilization come under attack by those who reject any alien influence.<br> <br> ANDOR: On the eve of a great celebration of their ancient past, the unusual and mysterious Andorians, a species with four sexes, must decide just how much they are willing to sacrifice in order to ensure their survival. Biological necessity clashes with personal ethics; cultural obligation vies with love&#x2014;and Ensign Thirishar ch'Thane returns home to the planet he forswore, to face not only the consequences of his choices, but a clandestine plan to alter the very nature of his kind.</p><p>Una McCormack is the author of seven previous&nbsp;<i>Star Trek</i>&nbsp;novels:&nbsp;<i>The Lotus Flower</i>&nbsp;(part of&nbsp;<i>The Worlds of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</i>),&nbsp;<i>Hollow Men</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Never-Ending Sacrifice</i>,&nbsp;<i>Brinkmanship</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Missing</i>, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Fall: The Crimson Shadow</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Enigma Tales</i>.

When you walked around the settlement, you could always feel them. You could usually make a good guess as to the time. <i>Like living in a sundial,</i> Keiko thought absently, propping her elbows on the windowsill and resting her chin in her hands, staring up at the peaks that marked and measured out the days at Andak.<br><br>The mountains were shot through with black rock, which would glitter when hit by the harsh Cardassian sun, sending sudden sharp shards of light over the base and the settlement. Obsidian, Feric had told her, and then had launched into an impromptu lecture about the volcanic activity that had formed this part of the province. It had been the subject of his thesis.<br><br>"Too much information, Feric!" she'd groaned as his eyes, beneath their ridges, took on a zealous gleam. "There's a very good reason I'm not a geologist!" He'd laughed, taking it in the good humor she'd intended, but couldn't resist adding a little bit more information <i>("Don't worry -- the volcanoes are extinct").</i> He was a first-rate scientist, and she hoped that soon enough he might also be a trusted friend. She was sure that she had made a good choice, appointing him as her deputy.<br><br>Early evening in Andak brought with it an acute light that, for an hour or more, seemed to settle upon the ancient valley and the new base that lay there in its folds. If you looked at the calendar, it was supposed to be autumn -- but the heat had not noticeably dissipated, and it endured even after it went dark. As the year died, Keiko had been told, and winter did come at last to the mountains, the days would become more barren and the nights would be bitterly cold. Cardassia, she suspected, had many cruelties left to reveal.<br><br>This evening, the sun seemed to have intensified further, and the efficient gray edges of the buildings were outlined with silver. It was still and hot -- and expectant, as if the valley was waiting for something to happen, as if it was waiting for some change. Keiko opened the window, wishing for a little breath of air upon her face. She watched as a small group of people -- ten or twelve, perhaps -- assembled in the dusty, unpaved square around which the settlement was ordered. Feric was among them. He stood for a while, speaking to one or two of those gathered, and then he and a young woman -- Keiko recognized her as one of the junior engineers -- moved a little distance away from the others. They each were carrying something, and it was only when they held these before them and then fastened them over their faces that Keiko saw that they were masks.<br><br>They turned to face one another, each studying the mask that hid the other from view. The moments slipped past more quickly now, and a hush had fallen over the others gathered there. They were drawn to the scene before them, and stood by unknowing, but eager, watching and waiting. Keiko gazed at this tableau as it held for a long, still moment. The mountains behind at first framed the scene and then, almost imperceptibly, seemed to become part of the composition.<br><br>A ripple passed through the onlookers as first Feric, then his companion turned to them. It seemed as if, each in turn, they became connected; whether by their own fascination or some other, more physical charge, they could not afterward tell. The sense of anticipation in the square was growing, the air was becoming slow. If this had been anywhere else, Keiko might have said a storm was coming.<br><br>The young woman began to speak, her voice low and rhythmical.<br><br><i>"The power that moves through me, animates my life, animates the mask of Oralius..."</i><br><br>There were some children in the square too this evening, Molly included, playing some game or other -- it looked to Keiko as if Molly was organizing proceedings. <i>Like mother, like daughter,</i> she thought, with a grin. Growing up on Deep Space 9 had been good for Molly in many ways. She seemed to be able to fit in wherever she was -- she certainly had none of her father's difficulties mixing with the Cardassians here, although there were some children hanging back, Keiko noticed, watching the games but not taking part. Well, Molly could be a bit much at first, if you were a shy kid. No doubt they'd get used to her in time, or perhaps get used to each other.<br><br><i>As must we all....</i><br><br>The woman was still chanting:<br><br><i>"It is the song of the morning, opening up to life, bringing the truth of her wisdom, to those who live in the shadow of the night..."</i><br><br>Keiko had known even before she'd set foot here that a large part of her job at Andak would be making the staff come together not just as a team, but as a community. Cloistered together, all this way out, it would be easy for feuds to grow, for minor incidents to take on massive significance -- for the place to become a hothouse of resentment and intrigue. Keiko was director here -- but it was not just the scientific research that would need her attention. A community, that's what she wanted too. And so she'd requested that the team she'd assembled should bring their families with them to Andak. It was only when the requisitions came through -- for living quarters, for rations -- that she began to realize what a Cardassian "family" might mean. Everyone at Andak had been touched by the war. She, Miles, Molly, and Yoshi -- they were the oddities: mother, father, sister, brother. No one else was that lucky. Some of them were the only survivors of their families: Feric, for one, had lost everyone -- mother, two sisters, a wife, and a little boy. When Feric looked at Yoshi, Keiko thought her heart would break -- another good reason to encourage a community at Andak.<br><br>She heard Feric's voice rising, clear and sure in the evening air.<br><br><i>"It is this selfsame power -- turned against creation, turned against my friend -- that can destroy his body with my hand, reduce his spirit with my hate..."</i><br><br>She'd had to fight a hard battle to get Feric's appointment confirmed, right the way up to the advisory board. At least Charles Drury back at the I.A.A.C. had supported her -- well, she was <i>his</i> appointment, after all, it wouldn't do to lose face and faith in your new research director <i>this</i> early on in the project....<br><br>"You've got your geologist, Keiko," he'd said, with a twist to his mouth, "Despite his, ah, <i>fascinating</i> beliefs..."<br><br>"He's a member of the Oralian Way, Charlie -- and don't raise your eyebrow at me like that. The only reason there's been this much fuss is that he's had the nerve to discuss his beliefs openly. And since when did the I.A.A.C. hire people based on their religion, or lack of it?"<br><br>"You make, as ever, a convincing case. But no more controversy if you please, Keiko," he'd said, leaning over to turn off the link. "The budget won't stand for many more emergency meetings. Catering for the great and the good doesn't come cheap, you know. The funding isn't <i>that</i> secure. Yet."<br><br><i>Politics, politics, politics...We're meant to be doing science!</i><br>0 <br><br>Keiko sighed and leaned her forehead against the cool plastic of the window. It would be all politics again tomorrow, she thought ruefully, with far too little chance for science. Abandoned on her desk, a padd flashed a lonely and unnecessary reminder that the following afternoon, the Andak Project was to be favored with the presence of one Vedek Yevir Linjarin. As if that weren't intruding on her every thought already. A high-profile visitor, putting the project under the spotlight. Yevir, it seemed, never went anywhere without a cavalcade of cameras in his wake. All in the cause of peace -- although it didn't seem to be doing his popularity back on Bajor much harm either....<br><br>Keiko chewed on her bottom lip. Playing the usual politics was bad enough, but when it meant putting aside all your personal feelings...Yevir had hurt a friend of hers, hurt her badly, and Keiko was going to have to spend tomorrow making good-mannered small talk with him. Her friend was a practiced politician herself these days and would understand, Keiko knew, but she would still feel a pang of guilt when she next had to look Kira in the eye.<br><br><i>Welcome to the Andak Project, Vedek Yevir. Here's a punch in the mouth in return for my friend's Attainder.</i><br><br>Now, <i>that,</i> Keiko suspected, would get the funding cut for sure. No, she thought with a grin, she'd better steer away from the Miles Edward O'Brien School of Diplomacy and stick with something a little more welcoming.<br><br>She cast an anxious and appraising eye around the settlement, at the buildings that seemed to her to sit as yet precariously on the land, and wondered how it would all appear to an outside observer. It was, she would be the first to admit, pretty basic, but there were far worse places to be on Cardassia Prime these days. They had come through the capital on their way out here -- that had been a shock. Keiko had <i>read</i> about it -- had known in an abstract way, the way you think you know things that you see on news broadcasts or read about -- but nothing had prepared her for the reality. Nothing had prepared her for the black, blasted landscape, for the dust and the dark, for the hollow eyes of the survivors trying to keep on living in the ruins. Trying to get down one street, they had been held up by workers clearing away the debris -- she remembered with a shudder watching as they unearthed a pile of skeletons....She'd only just distracted Molly's attention in time, before the little girl had seen. There had been risks, she and Miles knew, in first moving the family to Deep Space 9, then bringing them here to Cardassia. But there were limits. There were some things you had to protect your children from.<br><br>In the square, someone had started humming. Someone picked up the melody, then someone else -- and soon the whole assembly had joined in. The sound seemed to build up, seemed to be moving outward from the group, out into the whole of the square, the whole of the settlement, the whole of the valley of Andak. Keiko closed her eyes, listened, found herself thinking of the evening's heat, and the black mountains, and the sharp white light that filled the valley....<br><br>"Bloody <i>hell!"</i><br><br>Keiko's eyes shot open. She gave a wry smile. That had certainly killed the mood.<br><br>She looked over her shoulder and round their quarters with mounting disbelief. <i>He hasn't...tell me he hasn't...</i><br><br>But he had. He'd pulled one of the panels off the wall and was investigating what lay inside.<br><br>"What <i>are</i> you doing, Miles?"<br><br>"I can't get this thing to work properly. Damned Cardassian settings!"<br><br>Realization dawned on her. "Are you talking about the temperature modulators?"<br><br>He made a noise that she took to be agreement.<br><br>"Is <i>that</i> why it's so hot in here? <i>Miles!"</i> she scolded. "Why didn't you just leave it alone?"<br><br>He looked up at her. "You were complaining about the heat again last night, and we had it right down. Turns out the levels have been fixed for Cardassian physiology. I wanted to see if I could get it to go down a notch or two. Should have thought of it sooner."<br><br>"But now it's even <i>hotter!"</i> She turned away from the window to take a better look at what he was up to and grimaced at the sight. Spread all over just about every available space was a chaos of tools and cables. Yoshi was sitting on the floor, happily absorbed in the vital business of emptying out his father's toolkit and dispersing the contents as widely as possible. Teetering on the edge of a nearby table was a pot of <i>meya</i> lilies, paper-thin and exquisitely perfumed, that she had set out only that morning. She stepped across to rescue them, placing them out of harm's way on top of some nearby shelves. Nobody could colonize space as quickly and as thoroughly as Miles, when he put his mind to it.<br><br>"Miles," she said weakly, "what <i>have</i> you done to my home?"<br><br>"Eh?" He looked around. "Oh, don't worry about this. I'll have it all back inside and the panel on again before you know."<br><br><i>But I</i> already <i>know...!</i> she thought, and sighed, putting a hand to her forehead. From on top of her desk, the padd blinked at her, doggedly.<br><br>"Aren't you leaving for the capital in a few hours?" she said. "And are you packed yet?" Something else crossed her mind. "Is your presentation even <i>ready?"</i><br><br>He stuck his head again inside the panel and mumbled something.<br><br>"I can't hear you with your head in there, Miles."<br><br>He twisted his neck a little and glared at her. "I said, I'll finish it on the ride up."<br><br>Keiko, who was a mother of two and had once been a schoolteacher, knew guilt the moment she saw it. "So," she said, putting her hands on her hips, "Let me see if I've got this straight. Instead of finishing a presentation on which the whole future of this project may hang, <i>you</i> decided you were going to open up the wall, pull out a bunch of cables, and play with them?"<br><br>He looked round at her, his expression one of complete bafflement. "To fix the temperature modulators," he explained, as if to someone not quite following something very straightforward, and then he leaned over again. "Don't you know by now that everything I do is done to make you happy, sweetheart?" he added, and then quickly, and wisely, put his head back inside the panel -- where he bumped it, and swore again, under his breath.<br><br>Keiko came away from the window, and cleared a space on the couch to sit. Yoshi climbed up beside her, and put his hand in hers. "Don't play the innocent with me," she said, stroking his hair. "I know you two -- you're both in this together." He gave her a wide and guilt-free grin. Keiko tucked him under her arm, looked round at the anarchy into which her home had descended, and sighed.<br><br><i>Earth, Deep Space 9, Cardassia...Nothing</i> really <i>changes....</i><br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Paramount Pictures.

The cries belonged to autumn. <br><br>Autumn is when this story begins. In a damp fog, with the temperature hovering just above freezing, and a woman who suddenly realizes that freedom is at hand. She has found a hole in a fence. <br><br>It is the autumn of 1937. The woman is called Kristina Tacker and for many years she has been locked away in the big asylum near S�ter. All thoughts of time have lost their meaning for her. <br><br>She stares at the hole for ages, as if she does not grasp its significance. The fence has always been a barrier she should not get too close to. It is a boundary with a quite specific significance. <br><br>But this sudden change? This gap that has appeared in the fence? A door has been opened by an unknown hand, leading to what was until now forbidden territory. It takes a long time for it to sink in. Then, cautiously, she crawls through the hole and finds herself on the other side. She stands, motionless, listening, her head hunched down between her tense shoulders, waiting for somebody to come and take hold of her. <br><br>For all the twenty-two years she has been shut away in the asylum she has never felt surrounded by people, only by puffs of breath. Puffs of breath are her invisible warders. <br><br>The big, heavy buildings are behind her, like sleeping beasts, ready to pounce. She waits. Time has stood still. Nobody comes to take her back. <br><br>Only after prolonged hesitation does she take a first step, then another, until she disappears into the trees.<br><br>She is in a coniferous forest. There is an acrid smell, reminiscent of rutting horses. She thinks she can make out a path. She makes slow progress, and only when she notices that the heavy breathing which surrounded her in the asylum is no longer there can she bring herself to turn round. <br><br>Nothing but trees on every side. She does not worry about the path having been a figment of her imagination and no longer discernible, as she is not going anywhere in particular. She is like scaffolding surrounding an empty space. She does not exist. Within the scaffolding there has never been a building, or a person. <br><br>Now she is moving very quickly through the forest, as if she did have an objective beyond the pine trees after all. From time to time she stands, stock-still, as if by degrees turning into a tree herself. <br><br>Time does not exist in the forest. Only trunks of trees, mostly pine, the occasional spruce, and sunbeams tumbling noiselessly to the damp earth. <br><br>She starts trembling. A pain comes creeping under her skin. At first she thinks it is that awful itchy feeling that affects her sometimes and forces the warders to strap her down to prevent her from scratching herself raw. Then it comes to her that there is another reason for her trembling.<br><br>She remembers that, once upon a time, she had a husband.<br><br>She has no idea what has prompted that memory. But she recalls very clearly having been married. His name was Lars, she remembers that. He had a scar over his left eye and was twenty-three centimeters taller than she was. That is all she can remember for the<br>moment. Everything else has been repressed and banished into the darkness that fills her being.<br><br>But her memory is reviving. She stares round at the tree trunks in confusion.Why should she start thinking about her husband just here? A man who hated forests and was always drawn to the sea? A midshipman, and eventually a hydrographic survey engineer with the<br>rank of Commander, employed on secret military missions?<br><br>The fog starts to disperse, melting away.<br><br>She stands rooted to the spot. A bird takes off, clattering somewhere out of sight. Then all is silent again.<br><br>My husband, Kristina Tacker thinks. I once had a husband, our lives were intertwined. Why do I remember him now, when I have found a hole in the fence and left all those watchful predators behind?<br><br>She searches her mind and among the trees for an answer.<br><br>There is none. There is nothing.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>Late in the night the warders find Kristina Tacker.<br><br>It is frosty, the ground creaks under their feet. She is standing in the darkness, not moving, staring at a tree trunk.What she sees is not a pine tree but a remote lighthouse in a barren and deserted archipelago at the edge of the open sea. She scarcely notices that she is no longer alone with the silent tree trunks.<br><br>That day in the autumn of 1937 Kristina Tacker is fifty-seven years old. There is a trace of her former beauty lingering in her face. It is twelve years since she last uttered a word. Her hospital records repeat the phrase, day after day, year after year:<br><br><i>The patient is still beyond reach.</i><br><br>That same night: it is dark in her room in the rambling mental hospital. She is awake. A lighthouse beam sweeps past, time after time, like a silent tolling of light inside her head.<br><br>CHAPTER 3<br><br>Twenty-three years earlier, also on an autumn day, her husband was contemplating the destroyer <i>Svea</i>, moored at the Gal�rvarv Quay in Stockholm. Lars Tobiasson-Svartman was a naval officer and cast a critical eye over the vessel. Beyond her soot-stained funnels he could make out Kastellet and Skeppsholm Church. The light was grey, forcing him to screw up his eyes.<br><br>It was the middle of October 1914, the Great War had been raging for exactly two months and nineteen days. Lars Tobiasson-Svartman did not have unqualified faith in these new armoured warships. The older wooden ships always gave him the feeling of entering a warm room. The new ones, with hulls comprising sheets of armour-plating welded together, were cold rooms, unpredictable rooms. He felt deep down that these vessels would not allow themselves to be tamed. Beyond the coal-fired steam engines or the new oil-driven ones were other forces that could not be controlled.<br><br>Now and then came a gust of wind from Saltsj�n.<br><br>He stood by the steep gangplank, hesitating. It made him feel confused. Where did this insecurity come from? Ought he to abandon his voyage before it had even begun? He searched for an explanation, but all his thoughts had vanished, swallowed up by a bank of mist sweeping along inside him.<br><br>A sailor hurried down the gangplank. That brought Tobiasson-Svartman down to earth. Not being in control of himself was a weakness it was essential to conceal. The rating took his suitcases, his rolled-up sea charts and the brown, specially made bag containing his most treasured measuring instrument. He was surprised to find that the rating could manage all the cumbersome luggage without assistance.<br><br>The gangplank swayed under his feet. He could just make out the water between the quay and the hull of the ship, dark, distant.<br><br>He thought about what his wife had said when they said goodbye in their flat in Wallingatan.<br><br>'Now you're embarking on something you've been aching to do for so long.'<br><br>They were standing in their dimly lit hall. She had intended to accompany him to his ship before saying goodbye, but as she started to put on her gloves she hesitated, just as he had done at the foot of the gangplank.<br><br>She did not explain why the leave-taking had suddenly become too much for her. That was not necessary. She did not want to start crying. After nine years of marriage he knew it was harder for her to let him see her crying than to be naked before him.<br><br>They said goodbye hurriedly. He tried to reassure her that he was not disappointed.<br><br>In fact, he felt relieved.<br><br>He paused halfway along the gangplank, savouring the almost imperceptible motion of the ship. She was right. He had been longing to get away. But he was not at all sure what he was longing for.<br><br>Was there a secret inside him of which he was not aware?<br><br>He was very much in love with his wife. Every time he had to leave for a tour of duty and said goodbye to her, he unobtrusively breathed in the scent of her skin, kissing her hastily. It was as if he were laying down that perfume, as you do a fine wine, or perhaps an opiate, to take out whenever he felt so forlorn that he risked losing his self-possession.<br><br>His wife still used her maiden name. He had no idea why, and did not want to ask.<br><br>A tug boomed from the direction of Kastellholmen. A seagull hovered in the updraught over the ship.<br><br>He was a solitary man. His solitary nature was like an abyss that he was afraid he might one day fall into. He had worked out that the abyss must be at least forty metres deep, and that he would leap into it head first, so as to be certain of dying.<br><br>He was at the exact middle of the gangplank. He had estimated its total length by eye at seven metres. So now he was precisely three and a half metres from the quay and just as far from the ship's rail.<br><br>His earliest memories were to do with measurements. Between himself and his mother, between his mother and his father, between the floor and the ceiling, between sorrow and joy. His whole life was made up of distances, measuring, abbreviating or extending them. He was a solitary person constantly seeking new distances to estimate or measure.<br><br>Measuring distances was a sort of ritual, his personal means of reining in the movements of time and space.<br><br>From the start, from as far back as he could remember, solitude had been like his own skin.<br><br>Kristina Tacker was not only his wife. She was also the invisible lid he used to cover the abyss.<br><br>CHAPTER 4<br><br>On that October day in 1914, Stockholm was enveloped by barely noticeable drizzle. His luggage had been brought by handcart from Wallingatan, over the bridge to Djurg�rden and the Gal�rvarv Quay. Although there were just the two of them, the porter and himself, he felt as if he were taking part in a procession.<br><br>His suitcases were of brown leather. The specially made, calf-leather<br>bag contained his most precious possession. It was a sounding lead for<br>the advanced measuring of the ocean depths.<br><br>The lead was made of brass, manufactured in Manchester in 1701 by Maxwell &amp; Swanson. Their skilled craftsmen made optical and navigational instruments and exported them all over the world. The company had acquired renown and respect when they made the sextants used by Captain Cook on what was to be his final voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Their advertisements claimed that their products were used even by Japanese and Chinese seafarers.<br><br>Sometimes when he woke up during the night, filled with a mysterious feeling of unrest, he would get up and fetch his lead. Take it back to bed with him and hold it, pressed tightly to his chest. That usually enabled him to go back to sleep. The lead breathed. Its breath was white.<br><br>CHAPTER 5<br><br>The destroyer <i>Svea </i>was built at the Lindholmen shipyard in Gothenburg, and had left the slipway in December 1885. She was due to be taken out of active service in 1914 as she was already out of date, but that sentence had been suspended because the Swedish Navy had not prepared for the Great War. Her life had been saved at the very last second. She was like a working horse that had been spared at the moment of slaughter, and allowed back into the streets again.<br><br>Lars Tobiasson-Svartman reminded himself of the most important measurements relevant to the ship. <i>Svea </i>was seventy-five metres long and at the broadest point just aft of amidships she was slightly more than fourteen metres. The heavy artillery comprised two longrange 254-millimetre guns of the M/85 type, made by Maxim-Nordenfelt in London. The medium-range artillery was made up of four 150-millimetre guns, also made in London. In addition there was some light artillery and an unknown number of machine guns.<br><br>He continued thinking over what he knew about the vessel he was about to board. The crew comprised 250 regular and conscripted ratings, and twenty-two regular officers. The driving power, currently making the ship throb, came from two horizontal compound engines whose horsepower was generated by six boilers. In trials she had attained a speed of 14.68 knots.<br><br>There was one further measurement that interested him. The gap between the bottom of <i>Svea</i>'s keel and the bottom of the Gal�rvarv Quay was just over two metres.<br><br>He turned round and looked down at the quay, as if hoping that his wife might have turned up after all. But there was nothing to be seen apart from a few boys fishing and a drunken man who slumped on to his knees then slowly toppled over.<br><br>The gusts from Saltsj�n were growing stronger.

On her 30th birthday, she was given a Le Creuset cooking pot by her sister. Every time she used this pot, she thought, "If only all my possessions were like this, I'd never have to replace anything." The idea stalked her for months until finally (despite having close to zero technical ability) she gave in and started building a basic website. In January 2016, a journalist found BuyMeOnce on Twitter and pitched a story to <i>The Telegraph</i>. Over the next few days, the article went viral and Tara's world (and inbox) exploded. She quit her job and committed to spreading the BuyMeOnce message globally. Since then she has come to oversee a team of eight, all passionate about the BuyMeOnce mission; the team even includes her old boss.<b>From the Introduction</b><br><br> My grandmother&#x2019;s tights used to last forever. They were so strong, people could tow cars with them, and did! Granny got two pairs&#x2014;�one to wash and one to wear. But then, the manufacturers decided to change the way their stockings were made, and not for the better. So today, when I reach for a pair of tights, it&#x2019;s like playing panty hose roulette. Which pair will tear this morning?<br>It may not seem like a crisis to have a drawer stuffed with compromised hosiery, but I see it as a very small glimpse into a much larger problem. Our houses, our whole lives, have become stuffed full of things that let us down, causing our stress levels to skyrocket and our bank accounts to empty. But it&#x2019;s precisely because these things are poorly made, or just a fad, that we are perversely compelled to buy more of them.<br><br>But couldn&#x2019;t life be different? What if we decided to surround ourselves with beautiful, well-�made objects that lasted forever, instead of &#x201c;for now&#x201d; things that soon need replacing?<br><br>That was the seed of an idea that came to me in 2013. Before then, I was a dues-�paying, card-�carrying member of the impulse-�shopper club who never questioned the things I bought. I&#x2019;d always been a spendthrift; my mother says that as a child it never much mattered how much pocket money I was given, I was always broke. And this behavior carried on into adulthood. Once I&#x2019;d decided I wanted something, I &#x201c;needed&#x201d; it right away, and so my life and home became filled with stuff that was &#x201c;almost but not quite right.&#x201d; Longevity wasn&#x2019;t one of my criteria, so I owned temporary things, poorly thought-�through and soon-�regretted clothes or hobby and fitness equipment bought in fits of short-�lived enthusiasm.<br><br>My habitual impulse-buying eventually led to excessive credit-�card debt, leaving me feeling out of control, childish, and angry with myself. I would come home to a chronically cluttered house, which was exhausting to tidy or clean, and stare blankly at my piles of fast-�fashion clothes, wondering why I felt I had nothing to wear.<br><br>Like many people, I was stumbling through life believing that &#x201c;when this happens or when I have that, then I&#x2019;ll be happy.&#x201d; Without a clear sense of self, I&#x2019;d unconsciously mold my character into whatever I thought my partners wanted me to be. When my last relationship failed, therefore, I felt so lost, I had to spend some time on antidepressants. With my thirties looming, I felt as though I&#x2019;d screwed up my life and chucked it away like a used tissue.<br><br>At the same time, I&#x2019;d managed to fall into the moral wasteland that is the advertising world. My job was now to write ads for some of the world&#x2019;s biggest brands, trying to persuade people like me to buy more stuff, whether they needed it or not. A few years ago, while on vacation, I had a full-�on breakdown in front of my friends; and in the plane restroom on the way home, I looked in the mirror and vowed to make a change. I just wasn&#x2019;t sure what that change would be.<br><br>The change came in the form of a pot&#x2014;�a baby-�blue Le&nbsp;Creuset Dutch oven given to me for my thirtieth birthday. It came with a reputation for lasting for generations, and when I held it, it just felt like an heirloom. It was startlingly beautiful, and I reflected that owning it meant I potentially never had to buy another one again. &#x201c;If only everything in my life were like this,&#x201d; I thought.<br><br>Enthused, I set out to find more objects that I would never have to replace&#x2014;�objects that would work with me and grow old with me; beautiful, classic objects worth committing to and taking care of.<br><br>I assumed there&#x2019;d be a website that sold a collection of lifetime products, but when I went looking for one, it didn&#x2019;t exist. &#x201c;Maybe I could be the one to build it,&#x201d; I dared to think.<br><br>I had zero web-�design skills, but the more I thought about it, the more powerful the idea seemed. If this website could release people from the constant pressure to renew and replace, it might solve some of the biggest problems the world was facing. It would ease the clutter, unhappiness, and debt that came with overconsumption; lessen the environmental impact of our throwaway society; and save us all money in the long term.<br><br>I started to make changes in my own life and uncovered the surprising practical and emotional benefits that come with choosing to bring only those objects into your life that reflect your values and will be with you for decades to come.<br><br>I knew that if I didn&#x2019;t at least try to build the website, I&#x2019;d always regret it. So in 2015, I started BuyMeOnce.com, and began hunting for lifetime items in my spare time. I cut my salary in half and lived on minimum wage so I could split my time between my day job and building my business.<br><br>Painfully slowly, and after several false starts, the site started to come together. It was very basic and had no means of making money, and I had no idea if anyone would ever visit it. Most likely, I thought, it would remain a lonely result on the sixth page of a Google search.<br><br>Then, in 2016, miraculously and quite unexpectedly, the world found it. The site went viral, thousands of e-�mails flooded in, BuyMeOnce was featured in almost every major newspaper in the United Kingdom and I was suddenly being asked to be on TV in America. I hadn&#x2019;t realized it, but I had tapped into something that people all around the world were feeling. They were tired of our throwaway culture.<br><br>By this stage, my life had completely turned around. My spending was under control because I was living by my newfound philosophy. Sadly, I hadn&#x2019;t morphed into a &#x201c;naturally&#x201d; tidy person, but after giving away more than half my wardrobe and countless boxes of clutter, any mess I made was easily dealt with in a couple of minutes. Owning items I loved for the long term also meant I naturally started caring for them better and lost things less frequently. I&#x2019;d also stopped worrying about keeping up with the Joneses, and reconnected with the person I really was. This, together with doing something I truly believed in, had raised my self-�worth and allowed me to enter into a relationship based on a joyful connection rather than neediness. I had found my best friend, and now husband&#x2014;�a kind, funny, bespectacled man who makes me happier than I had imagined possible.<br><br>I now have the opportunity to share with you what I believe is a life-�enhancing way of thinking and behaving. My hope is that this book can be helpful on a personal level and, if it falls into the hands of enough people, helpful to the planet.</p><h2>The Invasion Year: An Alan Lewrie Naval Adventure (Alan Lewrie Naval Adventures, 17)</h2><p><p>The Invasion Year<i> is the seventeenth tale in Dewey Lambdin's smashing naval adventure series.</i></p><p>For a fellow like Captain Alan Lewrie, Royal Navy, who despises the French worse than the Devil hates Holy Water, it's hellish-hard to gain a reputation for saving them, not once but twice, when the French refugees from Haiti surrender to England rather than the vengeful ex-slave armies in November of 1803!<br>After that, it could be "all claret and cruising" in the Caribbean, but for a home-bound sugar convoy, one so frustrating as to make even the happy-go-lucky Alan Lewrie tear his hair out, kick furniture, and curse like . . . well, like a sailor! <br>Back in England for the first time in two years, there are honors from the Crown for gallant service . . . a lot more than he expected from King George III, who was having a bad morning, then a chance to move in Society after an introduction to an intriguing daughter of a peer. But then come secret orders to experiment with several types of "infernal engines of war," which might delay or postpone the dreaded cross-Channel invasion by Napoleon Bonaparte, his huge army, and his thousands of invasion craft. For the rest of 1804, Alan Lewrie and his crew of the Reliant frigate will deal with things more dangerous to them than they may prove to be to the French!</p></p><p><b>Dewey Lambdin</b> is the author of over twenty Alan Lewrie novels, which begin with <i>The King&#x2019;s Coat</i> and span the years of the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. A member of the U.S. Naval Institute and a Friend of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, he spends his free time working and sailing on a rather tatty old sloop. He makes his home in Nashville, Tennessee.<b>CHAPTER ONE<br></b>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Damme, but I do despise the bloody French!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Understandably, sir,&#x201d; the First Lieutenant softly agreed.<br>&#x201c;Their bloody general, Rochambeau,&#x201d; Captain Alan Lewrie, RN, further gravelled, &#x201c;he&#x2019;d surrender t&#x2019;that murderous General Dessalines and his Black rebel army, but he&#x2019;s too damned proud t&#x2019;strike to <i>us</i>?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, Dessalines <i>did</i> give them ten days&#x2019; truce to make an orderly exit, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott pointed out. &#x201c;Else, it would have been a massacre. Another, really.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t come out and surrender to us, soon, it&#x2019;ll be all &#x2018;Frogs Legs <i>Flamb�,</i>&#x2019; and Dessalines&#x2019; truce be-damned,&#x201d; Captain Lewrie said with a mirthless laugh as he extended his telescope to its full length for another peek into the harbour of Cap Fran�ois&nbsp;... and at the ships anchored inside, on which the French now huddled, driven from the last fingernail grasp of their West Indies colony.<br>Evidently, the Black victors of the long, savage insurrection were getting anxious over when the French would depart, too, for those solid stone forts which had guarded the port from sea assault showed thin skeins of smoke, rising not from cook-fires but from forges where iron shot could be heated red-hot, amber-hot, to set afire those ships and all the beaten French survivors aboard them&#x2014;soldiers, civilians, sailors, women, and children. <i>Root and branch, damn their eyes,</i> Lewrie thought; <i>burn &#x2019;em all, root and branch!</i><br>He lowered his glass and grimaced as he turned to face his First Officer, Lt. Geoffrey Westcott. &#x201c;Is it askin&#x2019; too much, d&#x2019;ye imagine, sir, that the Frogs could face facts? Which is the greater failure or shame&nbsp;... admittin&#x2019; the rebel slaves beat &#x2019;em like a rug, and surrenderin&#x2019; t&#x2019;them&nbsp;... or strikin&#x2019; to a civilised foe, like us? They&#x2019;ve <i>done</i> the first, so&nbsp;... what matters the second?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Perhaps it&#x2019;s the matter of Commodore Loring&#x2019;s terms, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott supplied, inclining his head towards their senior officer&#x2019;s flagship, idling under reduced sail further out to seaward. &#x201c;He will not let them dis-arm and sail for France on their parole.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Be a fool if he did,&#x201d; Lewrie said with a dismissive snort, &#x201c;and Admiralty&#x2019;d never forgive him for it if he did. We&#x2019;d, escort them to Jamaica, intern their civilians&nbsp;... make the women and kiddies comfortable&nbsp;... Rochambeau and all his officers&#x2019;d be offered parole, quarters, and funds &#x2019;til they&#x2019;re exchanged....&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, we&#x2019;d sling all their sailors and soldiers into the prisoner hulks,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott added with a touch of whimsy, then, in a tongue-in-cheek manner, said, &#x201c;And surely some of those French <i>jeunes filles,</i> or fetching young widows&nbsp;... surely some of them <i>are,</i> sir&nbsp;... might find themselves in need of a British officer&#x2019;s &#x2018;protection&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm, well...,&#x201d; Capt. Lewrie allowed, rocking on the balls of his feet, making his Hessian boots creak; they were new from a cobbler at Kingston, still in need of breaking in. &#x201c;I expect <i>you&#x2019;d</i> be one to make such an offer, Mister Westcott? I warrant you&#x2019;re a <i>generous</i> soul,&#x201d; he said with a leer. Since their first acquaintance fitting-out their new frigate at the renewal of the war with France a little after Easter, Lewrie had discovered that Geoffrey Westcott was a Buck-of-The-First-Head when it came to putting the leg over biddable young ladies&nbsp;... almost himself to the Tee, in his younger, frivolous days.<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... I <i>hope</i> to be, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott replied, shrugging in false modesty, or piety (it was hard to tell which), and flashing a brief, teeth-baring grin before turning sober and &#x201c;salty&#x201d; once more.<br>&#x201c;Wish ye joy of it,&#x201d; Lewrie said, turning to probe the harbour with his telescope once more.<br>Cap Fran�ois, casually known as &#x201c;Le Cap&#x201d; in better days, had at one time been the richest <i>entrep�t</i> on the French colony of Saint Domingue, rivalling Jacmel, Mole St. Nicholas, or Port-Au-Prince itself. Nigh a thousand ships had put in there each year with all the luxuries of Europe and the Orient, and had cleared laden deep with sugar, rice, molasses, and rum, making Saint Domingue the richest prize of all the Sugar Islands, richer than all the British possessions put together.<br>Cap Fran�ois and Mole St. Nicholas further west out towards the extreme Nor&#x2019;western cape of Saint Domingue were well placed for trade&#x2014;on the North side of the colony, accessible to the passages out into the broad Atlantic, which made for shorter voyages to American or European markets.<br><i>Give the Frogs</i> <i>a</i> little <i>credit,</i> Lewrie thought; <i>at least</i> they <i>made something of their half of Hispaniola.</i><br>The eastern half of Hispaniola was held by the Spanish, but San Domingo had never produced a pittance of wealth compared to the French half; cattle herding, sheep and pigs, subsistence farming&nbsp;... along with the <i>boucaniers</i> who dressed in hides, and had become the dreaded <i>buccaneers</i> of pirate lore.<br>Now, though&nbsp;... it was all lost, to both France and any other nation which might try to possess it; as Great Britain had in those early days of the French Revolution, when they&#x2019;d landed an army ashore, and had been fought back to the beaches and piers by the rebel slaves&nbsp;... when they weren&#x2019;t fighting their former <i>grands blancs</i> masters, or the <i>petits blancs</i> and half-bloods, or each other, for dominance.<br>That brute General Dessalines had once been an aide to the former house slave Toussaint L&#x2019;Ouverture, who&#x2019;d turned out to be a much more brilliant general than any that the French had sent to fight and die here. Over thirty generals, Lewrie had heard tell, and over fourty thousand French soldiers had perished, including Napoleon&#x2019;s brother-in-law, General LeClerc. Oh, LeClerc had managed to lure L&#x2019;Ouverture to a parley and had enchained him, then shipped him to die in an alpine prison in France&#x2014;dead of cold, hunger, and heart-break that Napoleon Bonaparte would betray him, the &#x201c;Napoleon of The West,&#x201d; and break all the promises of the French Revolution, of <i>Libert�, Fraternit�,</i> and <i>Egalit�,</i> of the heady vows of abolishing slavery anywhere in every French colony, in hopes that without L&#x2019;Ouverture, the rebellion would end.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t even Saint Domingue anymore, either. Now, the rebel slaves had begun to call it Haiti, or Hayti, which&#x2014;so far as Lewrie could tell from the many battles-to-the-death, the ambushes of whole battalions at a whack, the massacres of masters, mistresses, and overseers, and pretty-much anyone else of the former ruling castes, and the betrayals that had taken place here&#x2014;translated from Creole <i>patois</i> as &#x201c;Hell On Earth.&#x201d;<br>The last desperate refuges for the surviving French of Saint Domingue were the ships in harbour, anchored as far out as they could from the shore guns, but still be in the port proper; to venture out further would put them at risk of being raided and boarded at night by the blockading British squadron.<br>&#x201c;One&#x2019;d hope that Rochambeau had wits enough t&#x2019;spike his coast artillery, before he abandoned the forts, Mister Westcott,&#x201d; Captain Lewrie said to his waiting First Lieutenant.<br>&#x201c;Well&nbsp;... he <i>is</i> French, sir, so there&#x2019;s no telling.&#x201d;<br>Their frigate, HMS <i>Reliant</i>, along with the rest of the squadron that had sailed from Portsmouth in May on an independent mission, lay three miles to seaward of the coast, right at the edge of what had come to be accepted as the limits of a nation&#x2019;s, or island&#x2019;s, sovereignty, the Three Mile Limit. Three miles because that was the Range-To-Random Shot of the largest fortress gun then in use, the 42-pounder. <i>Had</i> the French ever had 42-pounders emplaced on Saint Domingue? Lewrie didn&#x2019;t know, but, just to err on the side of caution, that was how far out Commodore Loring had decided they would come to anchor.<br>&#x201c;He couldn&#x2019;t be <i>that</i> huge a fool as t&#x2019;leave &#x2019;em in place, then anchor right under &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Lewrie commented.<br>&#x201c;As I said, sir&nbsp;... he is French, after all,&#x201d; Westcott said.<br>&#x201c;Most-like, the rebels have only field guns&nbsp;... regimental guns of six-, eight-, or twelve-pound shot,&#x201d; Lewrie speculated.<br>&#x201c;Twelve-pounders firing heated shot would more than suffice, at that range from the shore to the anchored French, sir,&#x201d; Lt. Westcott opined as he briefly doffed his hat to swab his forehead with a faded handkerchief; almost the last day of November in the Year of Our Lord 1803 or not, it was a bright, sunny, and almost windless day.<br>&#x201c;Mmm-hmm,&#x201d; Lewrie agreed, intent again on the ships yonder.<br>There appeared to be at least two large <i>Compagnie des Indies</i> three-masted ships, as big as East Indiamen, perhaps another brace of similarly-sized French National ships of the line that seemed to be crammed from bilges to poop decks with humanity.<br><i>En flute,</i> or completely dis-armed, Lewrie judged them. <i>Else, they&#x2019;d be</i> completely <i>elbows t&#x2019;arseholes if they&#x2019;re still armed, and of a mind t&#x2019;resist us,</i> he told himself with a wry grin. <i>With no place t&#x2019;put the women and children if they tried.</i><br>There were a couple of frigates, one of them a very handsome and big one of at least 38 guns or better. There were some lighter, smaller two-masted brigs, even some locally-built schooners. Did the French...</p><h2>All About All About Eve: The Complete Behind-the-Scenes Story of the Bitchiest Film Ever Made!</h2><p><p>To millions of fans, <i>All About Eve</i> represents all that's witty and wonderful in classic Hollywood movies. Its old-fashioned, larger-than-life stars--including Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, and Celeste Holm--found their best roles in <i>Eve</i> and its sophisticated dialogue has entered the lexicon.</p><p>But there's much more to know about <i>All About Eve</i>. Sam Staggs has written the definitive account of the making of this fascinating movie and its enormous influence on both film and popular culture. Staggs reveals <i>everything</i> about the movie--from who the famous European actress Margo Channing was based on, to the hot-blooded romance on-set between Bette Davis and costar Gary Merrill, from the jump-start the movie gave Marilyn Monroe's career and the capstone it put on director Joseph L. Mankeiwicz's.</p><p><i>All About "All About Eve"</i> is not only full of rich detail about the movie, the director, and the stars, but also about the audience who loved it when it came out and adore it to this day.</p></p><p>Like the movie it celebrates, Sam Staggs's <i>All About All About Eve</i> is good, gossipy fun. The book is exhaustively researched, from behind-the-scenes anecdotes to a talk with the original, mysterious "Eve" who sparked the dinner party conversation that inspired the magazine story that eventually became one of the best movies ever made. The book spirals outward from the movie as well, chronicling the subsequent careers of the principals (and an ingenue newcomer named Marilyn Monroe), the life of writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and even the ill-fated romance of stars Bette Davis and Gary Merrill. It is, of course, the legendary on-set cattiness that is the focus of the book's first half (Celeste Holm claims that Bette Davis responded to her initial "Good morning" with a tart "Oh shit, good manners," and the two never spoke again; cast members dish about George Sanders's then-wife Zsa Zsa Gabor), but the overall tone of the book is one of affection and a deep fascination for even the smallest aspects of the film. A true fan, Staggs analyzes the position of <i>All About Eve</i> in its own time and in the camp culture of today, notes its influence on innumerable subsequent films, and even chronicles the somewhat manufactured "feud" between Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead that developed over Davis's characterization of Margo Channing. To keep it from getting too weighty, Staggs punctuates the book with sidebars, paying tribute to the career of Walter Hampden, the elderly actor who presents the Sarah Siddons award, and even working in a match-the-famous-quote-to-the-French-subtitle quiz. <i>All About All About Eve</i> succeeds best in its main purpose--making you want to watch the movie one more time. <i>--Ali Davis</i><p><b>Sam Staggs's</b> first book was <i>MMII: The Return of Marilyn Monroe</i>.

McManus has written a gripping history that will stand as the last word on this titanic World War II battle. </b><br><br> Nicknamed the Big Red One, 1st Division had fought from North Africa to Sicily, earning a reputation as stalwart warriors on the front lines and rabble-rousers in the rear. Yet on D-Day, these jaded combat veterans melded with fresh-faced replacements to accomplish one of the most challenging and deadly missions ever. As the men hit the beach, their equipment destroyed or washed away, soldiers cut down by the dozens, courageous heroes emerged: men such as Sergeant Raymond Strojny, who grabbed a bazooka and engaged in a death duel with a fortified German antitank gun; T/5 Joe Pinder, a former minor-league pitcher who braved enemy fire to save a vital radio; Lieutenant John Spalding, a former sportswriter, and Sergeant Phil Streczyk, a truck driver, who together demolished a German strong point overlooking Easy Red, where hundreds of Americans had landed.<br><br> Along the way, McManus explores the Gap Assault Team engineers who dealt with the extensive mines and obstacles, suffering nearly a fifty percent casualty rate; highlights officers such as Brigadier General Willard Wyman and Colonel George Taylor, who led the way to victory; and punctures scores of myths surrounding this long-misunderstood battle.<br><br> <i>The Dead and Those About to Die</i> draws on a rich array of new or recently unearthed sources, including interviews with veterans. The result is history at its finest, the unforgettable story of the Big Red One&#x2019;s nineteen hours of hell&#x2014;and their ultimate triumph&#x2014;on June 6, 1944.</p><p><b>John C.

He also serves as the official historian for the United States Army&#x2019;s Seventh Infantry Regiment.<p><br> Chapter 1<br><br> Background<br><br> Seven months earlier, almost to the day, a gloomy autumn mist blanketed the docks of Liverpool. The early November air was chilly but crisp and invigorating. By the thousands, soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division, many of whom were hard-core survivors of bitter fighting in North Africa and Sicily, descended wooden gangways and set foot upon the venerable soil of England. A band played "Dixie," followed by "The Sidewalks of New York." As the soldiers made their way to troop trains, a bevy of sharply contrasting emotions pervaded their ranks. Some were just happy to be out of combat. Many daydreamed about the pleasures Britain offered-pubs, beer, liquor, sightseeing, shelter, running water, but most of all, women. Some of those who had been with the division during its pre-combat training in Britain the year before looked forward to renewing acquaintances with British friends. In several instances, men were so excited that they let out spontaneous whoops of joy. "You can imagine the crescendo that crushed the ears of all within miles," Captain Joe Dawson, a company commander, wrote to his family in an attempt to describe the exaltation of his men.<br><br> But there was an undercurrent of tension and gloom, too. The return to England could only mean one thing: the Big Red One was returning to combat, probably in the forthcoming invasion of Hitler's Europe. After nearly a year of fighting, and a slew of victories in the Mediterranean theater, many of the soldiers felt they had earned the right to go home. Already fiercely proud of their outfit, and resentful of most outside authority, they had developed a cynical world-weariness that, for some, bordered on self-pity. After the Sicily campaign, hopeful rumors had spread that the division would be rotated back to the States to train new recruits. When the men boarded ships and found out they were heading to England, and thus eventually back to action, "it caused," in the recollection of one rifleman, "a lot of trouble among the soldiers, a lot of unrest and anger." For Lieutenant John Downing and his men, "the hope of going to the States . . . died hard. We could be sure . . . if we didn't go home this time, we wouldn't go home until the end of the war."<br><br> Many of the veterans felt this was unfair and unnecessary. They complained bitterly about the idea of going back into combat. After all, they had been fortunate enough to survive to this point; more prolonged action almost certainly meant that their chances of survival would be diminished. A man could evade the law of averages only so long before his luck ran out. "Their feeling was there must be other infantry units in the United States Army that could be utilized in the assault on Western Europe," Private Steve Kellman explained. There were, of course, other units, but none quite like the Big Red One. The division's experience in amphibious assaults made it indispensable to invasion planners (not to mention its familiarity in the very sort of town fighting, river crossings, mountain fighting, and combined arms maneuver warfare that would follow in the months after the invasion). Among the American infantry divisions available for the coming invasion of Omaha beach, none had actually assaulted a hostile shore. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley, commander of the First Army, with control over all U.S. ground forces in the coming invasion, knew this all too well. "Although I disliked subjecting the 1st to still another major landing," he wrote, "I felt that as commander I had no other choice. My job was to get ashore, establish a lodgment, and destroy the German. In the accomplishment of that mission, there was little room for the niceties of justice. I felt compelled to employ the best troops I had. As a result the division that deserved compassion as a reward for its previous ordeals now became the inevitable choice for our most difficult job." In essence, they could not be spared. The task ahead was far too important and far too challenging.<br> At Liverpool, the troops boarded trains that took them to southern England, where they would settle in and begin a new round of training. Many were miffed at the standing order to remove, for reasons of secrecy, shoulder patches and all other indicators of their unit affiliation. The lack of identifying unit insignia made them look like newly arrived stateside replacements instead of proud combat veterans. It seemed a direct affront to their pride and status. Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Wright, the division quartermaster, was so incensed at the order that he simply refused to follow it. Military police caught him, wrote him up, and referred his case to the First Army Provost Marshal. His defiance eventually evaporated, but only after the threat of a court-martial. He and thousands of other like-minded veterans grumbled, but swallowed their pride and complied with the order.<br><br> Even worse, in the view of many Big Red One soldiers, was something else that had happened near the end of the Sicily campaign. Bradley had decided to relieve Major General Terry de la Mesa Allen, the 1st Division's popular and colorful commanding officer. Allen was a soldier's soldier, a down-to-earth cavalryman who loved polo, whiskey, and earthy language. The son of a West Point graduate and the grandson of a Civil War officer, he was born to be a soldier. As a young man, Allen had washed out of West Point because of his independent nature and maverick tendencies, a dismissal that must have smarted for the scion of such a distinguished military family. True to his resilient nature, though, he rebounded from the setback to earn a degree from the Catholic University of America and a subsequent Regular Army commission. Allen's personality meshed perfectly with the independent professionalism of the 1st Infantry Division.<br><br> In combat, he was the embodiment of an inspirational commander-courageous, relentless, and energetic-the sort of general who circulated easily among subordinates from the lowest-ranking private to staff officers. On the Tunisian front, he had made a point of regularly visiting the forward positions and speaking to each man personally. "There is nothing that is more inspiring than to have a general walking about the front lines when the bullets are flying, talking with the men," one of his aides wrote about him in a letter home. "He doesn't know what the word fear is and he is just like a hypodermic to the men of his command."<br><br> He had little patience for niceties. In action, he dressed in a simple, rumpled olive-drab uniform, helmet often askew or at his side, smoking cigarettes, grinning, tossing around one-liners. He was a natural backslapper and storyteller. He enjoyed an easy familiarity with his men, yet he managed to maintain a strong command presence. Almost everyone who served in the 1st had encountered him firsthand and had come to love him, in part because of his magnetic personality, in part because of his competence, but mostly because of his obvious concern for their welfare. "Do your job," he once told his division. "We don't want . . . dead heroes. We're not out for glory. We're here to do a dirty, stinking job." Over the many months of combat in North Africa and Sicily, he had inculcated an aggressive spirit in his division. True to his cavalry roots, he believed in swift maneuvers, slash and dash, night attacks and esprit de corps.<br><br> He cared little for his own promotion or his postwar military career. Command of the unit was the limit of his ambition. The men sensed that they were his first priority, and they loved him for it. "General Allen was loved by his soldiers because he really cared about them," Corporal Sam Fuller once wrote. "He didn't give a damn about playing politics or being famous." Allen had no tolerance for anyone who messed with his boys, whether that meant the Germans or higher command. In combat, this attitude contributed to success, but when the unit was off the line, it sometimes led to disciplinary problems. In the Mediterranean, the 1st earned a reputation as a hard-fighting outfit on the line, but a hard-drinking, rebellious, troublemaking group away from combat, contemptuous of rear-echelon troops, higher authority, and, for that matter, anyone who wasn't affiliated with the division. Allen seemed not only to tolerate this attitude but to encourage it, at least in the view of Bradley, George Patton, Dwight Eisenhower, and other senior officers in the theater. The most notorious example occurred in the spring of 1943, after the Tunisia campaign. The combat-weary men of the division yearned to visit the bars and brothels of Oran, a city they had actually captured during the initial invasion of North Africa back in the fall of 1942. However, only soldiers in rear-echelon-style khaki uniforms were allowed into the city. The Big Red One soldiers were still clothed in the same filthy olive-drab wool uniforms they had worn all winter during the hard fighting among the hills of Tunisia. The combat men felt that if anyone should enjoy the pleasures of Oran, it should be the front-line soldiers who routinely risked their lives. Therefore, they deeply resented being excluded from the city at the expense of the "typewriter commandos," as they often referred to the service troops.<br><br> Allen was clearly sympathetic to the views of his men. He defied the off-limits order and issued passes for his soldiers to enjoy some R&amp;R in the city. A substantial amount of brawling, drinking, and mayhem ensued, involving both officers and enlisted men. "I can still remember the feeling I had when I landed a punch to some fat major's belly," Captain Edward Kuehn said. "We had taken Oran before, and we had lost a lot of good men doing it. Rearguard troops were not going to keep us from taking it this time, either." When Patton complained to Allen about the behavior of his soldiers, and demanded that he rein them in, Allen backed them to the hilt. "The troops have been in the line for six goddamned months," he exclaimed. "Let them celebrate getting back alive. It will stop soon." This was a revealing reaction and decision on Allen's part. A more career-conscious officer would have been eager to do the bidding of his superiors, regardless of what his men might have thought about that. Allen was different. Certainly his soldiers came first on his list of priorities, but perhaps he was also eager to remain popular among them even if that meant alienating the higher-ups.<br><br> In the view of senior officers, the Oran clashes represented more than just the usual tension between combat soldiers and rear-echelon types. Bradley, for instance, came to believe that a distinct whiff of parochialism, self-pity, and disregard for discipline and the chain of command emanated from the Big Red One. The soldiers had become a little too loyal to Allen and his equally charismatic assistant division commander, Ted Roosevelt, son of the former president. "Roosevelt was too much like Allen," Bradley wrote. "They looked upon discipline as an unwelcome crutch to be used by less able and personable commanders." The intense loyalty the troops held for these two generals was, in Bradley's estimation, coming at the expense of the greater loyalty soldiers owed to the Army as a whole. "Under Allen the 1st Division had become increasingly temperamental, disdainful of both regulations and senior commands," Bradley wrote. "It thought itself exempt from the need for discipline by virtue of its months on the line. And it believed itself the only division carrying its fair share of the war. Allen had become too much of an individualist to submerge himself without friction in the group undertakings of war." For the low-key Bradley, a duty-first man who disdained talented mavericks and nonconformity as a whole, the only sensible course of action was to remove Allen. In August 1943, near the end of the Sicily campaign, he fired him. Roosevelt also got the ax, in part because Bradley felt that he, too, had failed to enforce proper discipline and also because "Allen . . . would feel deeply hurt if he were to leave the division and Roosevelt were to remain." Both Patton and Eisenhower concurred with the decision.<br><br> Word of the firings hit the division like a sledgehammer. It was hard for the men to understand why such a successful commander had been cashiered. Some were resentful over Allen's relief; their bitterness hardened into anger at the brass and, ironically, an even more insular attitude about their division's greatness and the uselessness of all outsiders. Those who were a bit more even-tempered, like Lieutenant John Downing, simply thought of it as "a bad omen. If a new general took command, we could be sure we would continue on somewhere in combat." These suppositions were, of course, absolutely correct. Other men were simply mystified or sad. "He was the best liked commander that we ever had," Captain Charles Murphy, a company commander, told an interviewer decades later. On the evening Allen left to go home, Captain Dawson, who had worked closely with him, wrote to his family about the melancholy mood that pervaded the ranks: "Terry left tonight, and with him went a record unequaled by any general officer in the divisions of the U.S. Army. We've been through a lot and we all feel keenly sad about his going."<br><br> Under these circumstances, a lot was riding on Bradley's selection of a replacement for Allen. Fortunately, he made a very wise choice in Major General Clarence Huebner, a man whose personality could hardly have been more different from Allen's, but whose competence and courage were every bit his equal. Whereas Allen was born to soldiering, Huebner was drawn to it. While Allen's success was a testament to resilience and charisma, Huebner's was a testament to the Army's culture of meritocracy (at least for white men). Born to a non-military Kansas wheat-farming family, Huebner was educated in a one-room school of the sort that pervaded frontier lore. Hardened by an outdoor life of farm chores, he was an athletic youth, though he was only of medium build and height. He played football, baseball, and basketball in high school. During track season, he was a pole-vaulter. At the age of twenty, with a high school diploma to his credit, he went to work as a railroad secretary. He had no desire to spend his life as a clerk, though. In 1910 he left the job and decided to join the Army, enlisting as a cook in the 18th Infantry Regiment, a unit that became part of the 1st Division seven years later. Huebner discovered that he was a natural soldier. Over the next seven years, he rocketed from private to master sergeant. In 1916, he passed a competitive examination to become an officer and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in November of that year. By the time the division deployed to France in the spring of 1917, he was a first lieutenant. His combat record in World War I was one of the finest of that or any other war. In eighteen months of frontline leadership, he rose from a first lieutenant, leading a platoon, to a lieutenant colonel, leading a regiment at the tender age of thirty. He earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest award for valor, as well as the Distinguished Service Medal, for outstanding service. He also received a Silver Star, the Purple Heart (for a bad shrapnel wound ab...</p></p><h2>Managerial Economics: Concepts and Principles (Managerial Economics Collection)</h2><p>Economic principles inform good business decision making. Although economics is sometimes dismissed as a discourse of practical relevance to only a relatively small circle of academicians and policy analysts who call themselves economists, sound economic reasoning benefits any manager of a business, whether they are involved with production/operations, marketing, finance, or corporate strategy. Along with enhancing decision making, the field of economics provides a common language and framework for comprehending and communicating phenomena that occur within a business, as well as between a business and its environment. This text addresses the core of a subject commonly called managerial economics, which is the application of microeconomics to business decisions. Key relationships between price, quantity, cost, revenue, and profit for an individual firm are presented in form of simple conceptual models. The text includes key elements from the economics of consumer demand and the economics of production. The book discusses economic motivations for expanding a business and contributions from economics for improved organization of large firms. Market price quantity equilibrium, competitive behavior, and the role of market structure on market equilibrium and competition are addressed. Finally, the text considers market regulation in terms of the generic problems that create the need for regulation and possible remedies for those problems. Although the academic literature of managerial economics often employs abstract mathematics and large corporations create and use sophisticated mathematical models that apply economics, this book focuses on concepts, terminology, and principles, with minimal use of mathematics. The reader will gain a better understanding of why businesses and markets function as they do and how those institutions can function better.</p><p>Donald Stengel Fresno, CA; Professor and chair of the Department of Information Systems and Decision Sciences; California State University, Fresno</p><h2>Love Anthony</h2><p>From bestselling author and neuroscientist Lisa Genova&#x2014;whose novel <i>Still Alice</i> is now an Academy Award-winning film starring Julianne Moore&#x2014;comes a novel about autism, friendship, and unconditional love.

To be fair, she&#x2019;s not really alone. Jimmy is upstairs sleeping. But she feels alone. It&#x2019;s ten in the morning, and the girls are at school, and Jimmy will sleep until at least noon. She&#x2019;s curled up on the couch, sipping hot cocoa from her favorite blue mug, watching the fire in the fireplace, and listening.<br> <br>Rain and sand spray against the windows like an enemy attacking. Wind chimes gong repetitive, raving-mad music, riding gusts from some distant neighbor&#x2019;s yard. The wind howls like a desperately mournful animal. A desperately mournful wild animal. Winter storms on Nantucket are wild. Wild and violent. They used to scare her, but that was years ago when she was new to this place.<br> <br>The radiator hisses. Jimmy snores.<br> <br>She has already done the laundry, the girls won&#x2019;t be home for several hours, and it&#x2019;s too early yet to start dinner. She&#x2019;s grateful she did the grocery shopping yesterday. The whole house needs to be vacuumed, but she&#x2019;ll wait until after Jimmy is up. He didn&#x2019;t get home from work until after 2:00 a.m.<br> <br>She wishes she had the book for next month&#x2019;s book club. She keeps forgetting to stop by the library to check it out. This month&#x2019;s book was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. It was a quick read, a murder mystery narrated by an autistic teenage boy. She liked it and was especially fascinated by the main character&#x2019;s strange inner world, but she hopes the next one will be a bit lighter. They typically choose more serious literature for book club, but she could use a pleasant escape into a hot summer romance right about now. They all could.<br> <br>A loud bang against the back of the house startles her. Grover, their black Lab, lifts his head from where he&#x2019;s been sleeping on the braided rug.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Grove. It&#x2019;s just Daddy&#x2019;s chair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Knowing a big storm was on its way, she told Jimmy to take his chair in last night before he left for work. It&#x2019;s his &#x201c;cigar-smoking&#x201d; chair. One of the summer residents left it on the side of the road in September with a sign taped to it that read FREE, and Jimmy couldn&#x2019;t resist it. The thing is trash. It&#x2019;s a cedar Adirondack chair. In most places on Earth, that chair could weather a lifetime, but on Nantucket, the salty, humid air eventually degrades everything but the densest man-made composite materials. Everything needs to be extraordinarily tough to survive here. And probably more than a little dense.<br> <br>Jimmy&#x2019;s moldy, corroded chair belongs at the dump or at least in the garage, as Beth wisely suggested last night. But instead, the wind has just lifted it off the ground and heaved it against the house. She thinks about getting up and hauling the chair into the garage herself, but then she thinks better of it. Maybe the storm will smash it to pieces. Of course, even if this happens, Jimmy will just find some other chair to sit in while he smokes his smelly cigars.<br> <br>She sits and tries to enjoy her cocoa, the storm, and the fire, but the impulse to get up and do something nags at her. She can&#x2019;t think of anything useful to do. She walks over to the fireplace mantel and picks up the wedding picture of Jimmy and her. Mr. and Mrs. James Ellis. Fourteen years ago. Her hair was longer and blonder then. And her skin was flawless. No pores, no spots, no wrinkles. She touches her thirty-eight-year-old cheek and sighs. Jimmy looks gorgeous. He still does, mostly.<br> <br>She studies his smile in the photo. He has a slight overbite, and his eyeteeth jut forward a touch. When she met him, she thought his imperfect teeth added to his charm, lending just enough to his rugged good looks without making him look like a hillbilly. He has a self-assured, mischievous, full-out grin for a smile, the kind that makes people&#x2014;women&#x2014;put forth considerable effort to be the reason for it.<br> <br>But his teeth have started to bug her. The way he picks at them with his tongue after he eats. The way he chews his food with his mouth open. The way his eyeteeth stick out. She sometimes finds herself staring at them while he talks, wishing he&#x2019;d shut his mouth. They&#x2019;re pearly white in this wedding photograph, but now they&#x2019;re more caramel- than cream-colored, abused by years of daily coffee and those smelly cigars.<br> <br>His once beautiful teeth. Her once beautiful skin. His annoying habits. She has them, too. She knows her nagging drives him crazy. This is what happens when people get older, when they&#x2019;re married for fourteen years. She smiles at Jimmy&#x2019;s smile in the picture, then replaces it on the mantel a little to the left of where it was before. She takes a step back. She purses her lips and eyes the length of the mantel.<br> <br>Their fireplace mantel is a six-foot-long, single piece of driftwood hung over the hearth. They found it washed up on the shore one night on Surfside Beach during that first summer. Jimmy picked it up and said, We&#x2019;re hanging this over the fireplace in our house someday. Then he kissed her, and she believed him. They&#x2019;d only known each other for a few weeks.<br> <br>Three pictures are on the mantel, all in matching weathered, white frames&#x2014;one of Grover when he was six weeks old on the left, Beth and Jimmy in the middle, and a beach portrait of Sophie, Jessica, and Gracie in white shirts and floral, pink peasant skirts on the right. It was taken just after Gracie&#x2019;s second birthday, eight years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where does the time go?&#x201d; she says aloud to Grover.<br> <br>A huge, peach starfish that Sophie found out by Sankaty Lighthouse flanks the Beth-and-Jimmy picture on the left, and a perfect nautilus shell, also huge and without a single chip or crack, flanks the Beth-and-Jimmy picture on the right. Beth found the nautilus shell out on Great Point the year she married Jimmy, and she protected it vigilantly through three moves. She&#x2019;s picked up hundreds of nautilus shells since and has yet to find another one without a flaw. This is always the arrangement on the mantel. Nothing else is allowed there.<br> <br>She adjusts her wedding picture again, slightly to the right, and steps back. There. That&#x2019;s better. Perfectly centered. Everything as it should be.<br> <br>Now what? She&#x2019;s on her feet, feeling energized.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Grover. Let&#x2019;s go get the mail.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside, she immediately regrets the idea. The wind whips through her heartiest &#x201c;windproof&#x201d; winter coat as if it were a sieve. Chills tumble down her spine, and the cold feels like it&#x2019;s worming its way deep into her bones. The rain is coming at her sideways, slapping her in the face, making it difficult to keep her eyes open enough to see where they&#x2019;re going. Poor Grover, who was warm and happy and asleep a few moments ago, whimpers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Grove. We&#x2019;ll be home in a minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>The mailboxes are about a half mile away. Beth&#x2019;s neighborhood is inhabited by a smattering of year-rounders and summer residents, but mostly summer people live on her route to the mail. So this time of year, the houses are empty and dark. There are no lights on in the windows, no smoke billowing from the chimneys, no cars parked in the driveways. Everything is lifeless. And gray. The sky, the earth, the weathered cedar shingles on every empty, dark house, the ocean, which she can&#x2019;t see now but can smell. It&#x2019;s all gray. She never gets used to this. The tedious grayness of winter on Nantucket is enough to unravel the most unshakable sanity. Even the proudest natives, the people who love this island the most, question themselves in March.<br> <br>Why the hell do we live on this godforsaken spit of gray sand?<br> <br>Spring, summer, and fall are different. Spring brings the yellow daffodils, summer brings the Mykonos-blue sky, fall brings the rusty-red cranberry bogs. And they all bring the tourists. Sure, the tourists come with their downsides. But they come. Life! After Christmas Stroll in December, they all leave. They return to mainland America and beyond, to places that have such things as McDonald&#x2019;s and Staples and BJ&#x2019;s and businesses that are open past January. And color. They have color.<br> <br>COLD, WET, AND miserable, she arrives at the row of gray mailboxes lining the side of the road, opens the door to her box, pulls out three pieces of mail, and quickly shoves them inside her coat to protect them from the rain.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Grover. Home!&#x201d;<br> <br>They turn around and begin retracing their route. With the rain and wind pushing behind her now, she&#x2019;s able to look up to see where she&#x2019;s going instead of mostly down at her feet. Ahead of them in the distance, someone is walking toward them. She wonders who it could be.<br> <br>As they get closer, she figures out that the person is a woman. Most of Beth&#x2019;s friends live mid-island. Jill lives in Cisco, which isn&#x2019;t too far from here, but in the other direction, toward the ocean, and this woman is too short to be Jill. She&#x2019;s wearing a hat, a scarf wrapped around her nose and mouth, a parka, and boots. It would be hard to recognize anyone in that getup in this weather, but surely, Beth must know who it is. There are only so many people who would be out walking in this neighborhood in this weather on a Thursday in March. There are no weekenders or day-trippers out for a stroll on Nantucket today.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re a few yards apart now, but Beth still can&#x2019;t identify her. She can only see that the woman&#x2019;s hair is long and black. Beth prepares to say Hello, and she&#x2019;s already smiling when the woman is directly in front of her, but the woman is fixated on the ground, refusing eye contact. So Beth doesn&#x2019;t say Hello, and she feels sheepish for smiling. Grover wanders over for a sniff, but the woman skirts by too quickly and is then behind them before Beth or Grover can learn anything more about her.<br> <br>Still curious after a few steps, Beth looks back over her shoulder and sees the woman at the row of mailboxes, toward the far end.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably a New Yorker,&#x201d; she mutters as she turns around and presses on toward home.<br> <br>Safe inside, Grover shakes himself, sending water everywhere. She&#x2019;d normally scold him for doing this, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Just opening the door splashed a bucket&#x2019;s worth of water into the mudroom. She removes her hat and coat, and the mail falls to the ground. She kicks off her boots. She&#x2019;s soaked through.<br> <br>She peels off her wet socks and jeans, tosses them into the laundry room, and slips into a pair of fleece pajama bottoms and a pair of slippers. Feeling warmer and drier and immediately happier, she returns to the front door to collect the mail from the floor, then walks back to the couch. Grover has returned to the braided rug.<br> <br>The first piece of mail is the heating bill, which will probably be more than their monthly mortgage payment. She decides to open it later. The next is a Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalog. She ordered one push-up bra three Christmases ago, and they still keep sending her catalogs. She&#x2019;ll toss it into the fire. The last piece of mail is an envelope hand-addressed to her. She opens it. It&#x2019;s a card with a birthday cake pictured on the front.<br> <br>May all your wishes come true.<br> <br>Huh, that&#x2019;s strange, she thinks. Her birthday isn&#x2019;t until October.<br> <br>Inside, the words Happy Birthday have been crossed out with a single, confident ballpoint blue line. Below it, someone has written:<br> <br>I&#x2019;m sleeping with Jimmy.<br> <br>PS. He loves me.<br> <br>It takes her a few seconds to reread it, to make sure she&#x2019;s comprehending the words. She&#x2019;s aware of her heart pounding as she picks up the envelope again. Who sent this? There&#x2019;s no return address, but the postmark is stamped from Nantucket. She doesn&#x2019;t recognize the handwriting. The penmanship is neat and loopy, a woman&#x2019;s. Another woman&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Holding the envelope in one hand and the card in the other, she looks up at the fireplace mantel, at her perfectly centered wedding picture, and swallows. Her mouth has gone dry.<br> <br>She gets up and walks to the fireplace. She slides the iron screen aside. She tosses the Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalog onto the fire and watches the edges curl and blacken as it burns and turns to gray ash. Gone. Her hands are shaking. She clenches the envelope and card. If she burns them now, she can pretend she never saw them. This never existed.<br> <br>A swirl of unexpected emotion courses through her. She feels fear and fury, panic and humiliation. She feels nauseous, like she&#x2019;s going to be sick. But what she doesn&#x2019;t feel is surprised.<br> <br>She closes the gate. With the card and envelope squeezed in her fist, she marches up the stairs, emphasizing each loud step as she heads toward Jimmy&#x2019;s snoring.</p><h2>Necessity&#39;s Child (Liaden Universe)</h2><p>#16<i> </i>in the popular and exciting science fiction Liaden Universe�.

This pervasive yet little- examined obsession with bargains is arguably the most powerful and devastating market force of our time, having fueled an excess of consumerism that blights our land�scapes, escalates personal debt, lowers our standard of living, and even skews of our concept of time. <br><br> Spotlighting the peculiar forces that drove Americans away from quality, durability, and craftsmanship and towards quantity, quantity, and more quantity, Ellen Ruppel Shell traces the rise of the bargain through our current big-box profusion to expose the astronomically high cost of cheap.</p><p>Ellen Ruppel Shell is a correspondent for the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and has written for <i>The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, National Geographic, Time, Discover, Seed</i>, and dozens of other national publications. She is the author, most recently, of <i>The Hungry Gene</i>, which was published in six languages, and is Associate Professor and Co-Director of the Knight Center for Science and Medical Journalism at Boston University."That cycle of consumption seems harmless enough, particularly since we live in a country where there are plenty of cheap goods to go around. But in her lively and terrifying book "Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture," Ellen Ruppel Shell pulls back the shimmery, seductive curtain of low-priced goods to reveal their insidious hidden costs. Those all-you-can-eat Red Lobster shrimps may very well have come from massive shrimp-farming spreads in Thailand, where they've been plumped up with antibiotics and possibly tended by maltreated migrant workers from Burma, Cambodia and Vietnam. The made-in-China toy train you bought your kid a few Christmases ago may have been sprayed with lead paint -- and the spraying itself may have been done by a child laborer, without the benefit of a protective mask. <br><br> "Cheap" is hardly a finger-waggling book. This isn't a screed designed to make us feel guilty for unknowingly benefiting from the hardships of workers in other parts of the world. And Shell -- who writes regularly for the Atlantic -- isn't talking about the shallowness of consumerism here; she makes it clear that she, like most of us, enjoys the hunt for a good deal. "Cheap" really is about us, meaning not just Americans, but citizens of the world, and about what we stand to lose in a global economic environment that threatens the very nature of meaningful work, work we can take pride in and build a career on -- or even at which we can just make a living.<br> -Stephanie Zacharek, Salon.com <br><br> <b>"This highly intelligent and disturbing book provides invaluable insight into our consumer culture and should be mandatory reading for anyone trying to figure out our current financial mess. As Shell proves, the hunt for cheap products has hurt us all. Highly recommended for smart readers." -<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br> "Diligent, useful cultural criticism, akin to Eric Schlosser's <i>Fast Food Nation</i> and Tom Vanderbilt's <i>Traffic</i>."<br>-<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> "I just finished Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture by Ellen Ruppel Shell and I am now both disgusted and totally freaked out. Ed is hosting a round table discussion on this one in the coming weeks which I am a part of so I won't go into too much detail here but really, Shell has done an outstanding job of bringing together all the facets of our need to buy cheap: food, clothing, furniture, etc. She doesn't just talk Wal-mart (in fact she doesn't talk much about Wal-mart at all) but she does talk IKEA and Red Lobster and China and the history of discount shopping in our country (Woolworths, etc.) which is truly fascinating. Beyond all the info though, Shell's writing style is utterly and completely top notch. This is popular history/culture at its finest and after you read it, you will approach every single purchase you make with a high level of suspicion. <br><br>&nbsp; We have been roundly manipulated folks, for our entire lives. And while we all kinda know it, you have to read Cheap to really appreciate it. Staggering stuff."<br> -Colleen Mondor, reviewer for Booklist, Bookslut, Eclectica Magazine and the Voices of New Orleans <br><br> "Talk about timely!-in the midst of our economic confusion, Ellen Ruppel Shell talks good sense about cost, price, value-about what constitutes a bargain, and about what makes for a (literal) steal."<br>-Bill McKibben, author of <i>Deep Economy</i><br><br> "Americans have always loved a good deal. But, as this courageous book argues, that love has evolved into a destructive obsession. Shell shows through in-depth reporting that our never- ending hunt for discounts has fed a plethora of social ills. And by moving our production to the world's lowest-cost labor markets, we have scarified such basic values as handcraftsmanship and product integrity. As <i>Cheap</i> ably proves, you get what you pay for."<br>-Dana Thomas, author of <i>Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster</i><br><br> "There is no free lunch. Ellen Ruppel Shell powerfully argues that we have paid a high price for buying cheap goods. Hers is compelling story that will hopefully convince Americans that making different choices as consumers can fundamentally change our society-and the world."<br>- Lizabeth Cohen, author of <i>A Consumers' Republic</i><br><br> "Around the world, people are being forced to reconsider the very idea of prosperity, and to ask what kind of wealth matters most and can be sustained. <i>Cheap</i> appears at just the right moment to enrich this discussion. This history of discounting and bargain-mania will change the way shoppers think about their next trip to the mall. As an examination of the global effects of the quest for rock-bottom prices, <i>Cheap</i> an important addition to arguments about America's economic future. This is a valuable book for a troubled time."<br>-James Fallows, author of <i>Postcards from Tomorrow Square</i><br><br> "More stuff for less! -the American recipe for material well-being. Now Ellen Ruppel Shell takes a hard look at this apparently simple notion and finds it isn't so simple after all. <i>Cheap</i> pulls apart the old economic verities and subjects the glib new promises of Wall Street and globalization to scrutiny. How did we find ourselves in our current mess? Shell finds part of the answer in our confused ideas about what, exactly, is a bargain price."<br>-Charles C. Mann, author of <i>1491</i></p><h2>The Boy Knight: A Tale of the Crusades</h2><p><i>The Boy Knight: A Tale of the Crusades</i> is the tale of a young man facing many trials in battle during the excitement of the Crusades.

Henty was born in Trumpington, near Cambridge. He was a sickly child who had to spend long periods in bed. During his frequent illnesses he became an avid reader and developed a wide range of interests which he carried into adulthood. <br> <br> Henty usually researched his novels by ordering several books on the subject he was writing on from libraries, and consulting them before beginning writing. Some of his books were written about events (such as the Crimean War) that he witnessed himself. Hence these books are thus written with greater detail as Henty drew upon his first-hand experiences of people, places, and events.</p><h2>Medieval Medicine And the Plague (Medieval World)</h2><p>Illustrates how death and incurable disease were considered a common part of medieval life and offers a history of the Black Death, or the plague, which killed millions of people in Europe.</p><p>&#34;Crabtree&#39;s Medieval World series...feature(s) color illustrations that are photographs of archival medieval book and tapestry illustrations, with some original drawings skillfully done to blend in.

And Sail Around the World? Alayne Main was 28 years old with an exciting medical career and minimal sailing experience, but she lived up to her sailing promise. She and her husband quit their jobs, bought a 33-foot catamaran and blithely sailed away! The challenges were immense - storms at sea, a collision with a whale and the threat of pirates - but her greatest challenge was the emotional turmoil their adventurous and uncertain lifestyle created. Her relationship deteriorating, Alayne was forced to deal with her fear and understand what drove her to continue to sail across vast unpredictable oceans - with only her husband to turn to. After four years, they came home as circumnavigators - and still married. An honest, deeply moving and wonderfully woven tale of a young woman&#39;s journeys - into herself, her marriage and around the world. Anyone in a partnership - man or woman, sailor or not - will benefit from this book.</p><p>Alayne Main sailed over 32,000 nautical miles with her husband on their catamaran. She now practices medicine and lives beside a lake in Southwestern Ontario with her husband and two young children. This is her first book.Main and her husband, Alec, put their jobs on hold for three years, bought a 33' catamaran and followed his dream of sailing around the world. Some 32,000 miles later, they had survived terrible storms at sea, eaten strange and exotic foods, encountered menacing sailors (pirates?), and become part of an amorphous community of waterborne adventurers. But the oceangoing life often frightens Main and tests her marriage. In fact, the first half of the book focuses primarily on her unhappiness with her own self-doubts, her husband for not being more sympathetic, and her general loneliness. By the second half of the book (and journey), she has come to terms with herself and her husband, and the places they visit and people they meet take center stage. The reader finally begins to feel the joy of exploring the world. Part travel chronicle, part self-exploration, and not entirely satisfactory on either account, this book is only for the most complete of public library adventure collections.ALinda M.

Quoting contemporary documents in full or in great extent, the author describes and analyzes the forces and cross-currents that controlled Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, the Persian and Teutonic regions; the rise of Byzantine power, territorial expansion, conflict of church and state, legislative and diplomatic changes; and scores of similar topics.<br>Detailed coverage of such important figures as Belisarius, Justinian, Procopius, Alaric, Attila, and many others is given as well as a complete contemporary account of a visit to Attila&#x2019;s court. The Vandal empire, the Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Lombards, etc., are given extensive treatment. Professor Bury investigates the literary, cultural, and religious history of the period in great detail and relates it to the organization and development of the Eastern and Western empires and the diffusion of Byzantine culture into Italy.<br>&#x201c;An important and valuable contribution to our knowledge of a period the history of which has been too much neglected.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Classical Review.</i></p><p></p><h2>A Year in Japan</h2><p>The Land of the Rising Sun is shining brightly across the American cultural landscape. Recent films such as <i>Lost in Translation</i> and <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i> seem to have made everyone an expert on Japan, even if they've never been there. But the only way for a Westerner to get to know the real Japan is to become a part of it. Kate T. Williamson did just that, spending a year experiencing, studying, and reflecting on her adopted home. She brings her keen observations to us in <i>A Year in Japan,</i> a dramatically different look at a delightfully different way of life. <br><br>Avoiding the usual clich�s--Japan's polite society, its unusual fashion trends, its crowded subways--Williamson focuses on some lesser-known aspects of the country and culture. In stunning watercolors and piquant texts, she explains the terms used to order various amounts of tofu, the electric rugs found in many Japanese homes, and how to distinguish a maiko from a geisha. She observes sumo wrestlers in traditional garb as they use ATMs, the wonders of "Santaful World" at a Kyoto department store, and the temple carpenters who spend each Sunday dancing to rockabilly. <i>A Year in Japan</i> is a colorful journey to the beauty, poetry, and quirkiness of modern Japana book not just to look at but to experience.</p><p>Kate T. Williamson is a writer and illustrator who studied filmmaking at Harvard University. Her love of travel and interest in sock design, along with a postgraduate fellowship, took her to Kyoto. She lives in New York City.This delicately crafted artist's journal offers colorful impressions of a young woman's extended visit in Kyoto, Japan. Williamson's watercolors are playful, bright and spare, and each section illustrates a theme or topic that has inspired the artist/author over her travels to a country devoted to attention to detail. For example, Williamson explores numerous rituals of dining, such as offering a guest green tea accompanied by a piece of <i>wagashi</i>, or bean paste confection, and illustrates over two pages the elegant lunch she ordered at a temple serving <i>shojin ryori</i>, the vegetarian cuisine of Zen Buddhist monks. The sacred rope that unites the "male" and "female" rocks of the Shinto site Meoto-Iwa warrants both an intimate view (the rope) and a full, breathtaking seascape of the wedded rocks. Williamson renders eye-catching holidays from August's <i>O'bon</i>, featuring a trio of three white-socked and sandaled feet under pink kimonos, to April's stately <i>sakura</i> (cherry blossom) season. Some of the people Williamson depicts are sumo wrestlers wearing headphones and riding the subway, and two geishas side by side in full regalia&#x2014;one apprentice, the other professional. For travelers to Japan, and those who treasure their visit, this is a splendid record. 350 color illus. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A modest burg they called a city, nine-�tenths jungle. An island. It ran along a coastal barrier the other side of Biscayne Bay from young Miami&#x2014;�in 1868 when Henry Lum, a California &#x2019;forty-�niner, first glimpsed the island from a schooner, you may be certain it was jungle, cocoanut palms on the sand, mangrove swamp and palmetto thicket ten feet off the beach. But by 1915, they were working the vein. John S. Collins, a New Jersey nurseryman (after whom Collins Avenue is kindly named) brought in bean fields and avocado groves; a gent named Fisher, Carl G., a Hoosier&#x2014;�he invented Prestolite, a millionaire&#x2014;�bought up acres from Collins, brought in a work-�load of machinery, men, even two elephants, and jungle was cleared, swamps were filled, small residential islands were made out of baybottom mud, dredged, then relocated, somewhat larger natural islands adjacent to the barrier island found themselves improved, streets were paved, sidewalks put in with other amenities&#x2014;�by 1968, one hundred years after Lum first glommed the beach, large areas of the original coastal strip were covered over altogether with macadam, white condominium, white luxury hotel and white stucco flea-�bag. Over hundreds, then thousands of acres, white sidewalks, streets and white buildings covered the earth where the jungle had been. Is it so dissimilar from covering your poor pubic hair with adhesive tape for fifty years? The vegetal memories of that excised jungle haunted Miami Beach in a steam-�pot of miasmas. Ghosts of expunged flora, the never-�born groaning in vegetative chancery beneath the asphalt came up with a tropical curse, an equatorial leaden wet sweat of air which rose from the earth itself, rose right up through the baked asphalt and into the heated air which entered the lungs like a hand slipping into a rubber glove.<br><br>The temperature was not that insane. It hung around 87 day after day, at night it went down to 82, back to the same 87 in the a.m.&#x2014;�the claims of the News Bureau for Miami Beach promised that in 1967 temperature exceeded 90� only four times. (Which the Island of Manhattan could never begin to say.) But of course Miami Beach did not have to go that high, for its humidity was up to 87 as well&#x2014;�it was, on any and every day of the Republican Convention of 1968, one of the hottest cities in the world. The reporter was no expert on tropical heats&#x2014;�he had had, he would admit, the island of Luzon for a summer in World War II; and basic training in the pine woods of Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in August; he had put in a week at Las Vegas during July&#x2014;�temperatures to 110; he had crossed the Mojave Desert once by day; he was familiar with the New York subway in the rush hour on the hottest day of the year. These were awesome immersions&#x2014;�one did not have to hit the Congo to know what it was like in a hothouse in hell&#x2014;�but that 87� in Miami Beach day after day held up in competition against other sulphuric encounters. Traveling for five miles up the broken-�down, forever in-�a-�state-�of-�alteration and repair of Collins Avenue, crawling through 5 p.m. Miami Beach traffic in the pure miserable fortune of catching an old taxi without air conditioning, dressed in shirt and tie and jacket&#x2014;�formal and implicitly demanded uniform of political journalists&#x2014;�the sensation of breathing, then living, was not unlike being obliged to make love to a 300-�pound woman who has decided to get on top. Got it? You could not dominate a thing. That uprooted jungle had to be screaming beneath.<br><br>Of course it could have been the air conditioning: natural climate transmogrified by technological climate. They say that in Miami Beach the air conditioning is pushed to that icy point where women may wear fur coats over their diamonds in the tropics. For ten miles, from the Diplomat to the Di Lido, above Hallandale Beach Boulevard down to Lincoln Mall, all the white refrigerators stood, piles of white refrigerators six and eight and twelve stories high, twenty stories high, shaped like sugar cubes and ice-�cube trays on edge, like mosques and palaces, shaped like matched white luggage and portable radios, stereos, plastic compacts and plastic rings, Moorish castles shaped like waffle irons, shaped like the baffle plates on white plastic electric heaters, and cylinders like Waring blenders, buildings looking like giant op art and pop art paintings, and sweet wedding cakes, cottons of kitsch and piles of dirty cotton stucco, yes, for ten miles the hotels for the delegates stood on the beach side of Collins Avenue: the Eden Roc and the Fontainebleau (Press Headquarters), the Di Lido and the De Lano, the Ivanhoe, Deauville, Sherry Frontenac and the Monte Carlo, the Cadillac, Caribbean and the Balmoral, the Lucerne, Hilton Plaza, Doral Beach, the Sorrento, Marco Polo, Casa�blanca, and Atlantis, the Hilyard Manor, Sans Souci, Algiers, Carillon, Seville, the Gaylord, the Shore Club, the Nautilus, Montmartre, and the Promenade, the Bal Harbour on North Bay Causeway, and the Twelve Caesars, the Regency and the Americana, the Diplomat, Versailles, Coronado, Sovereign, the Waldman (dig!), the Beau Rivage, the Crown Hotel, even Holiday Inn, all oases for technological man. Deep air conditioning down to 68�, ice-�palaces to chill the fevered brain&#x2014;�when the air conditioning worked. And their furnishings were monumentally materialistic. Not all of them: the cheaper downtown hotels like the Di Lido and the Nautilus were bare and mean with vinyl �coverings on the sofas and the glare of plastic off the rugs and ta�bles and tiles, inexpensive hotel colors of pale brown and buff and dingy cream, sodden gray, but the diadems like the Fontaine�bleau and the Eden Roc, the Doral Beach, the Hilton Plaza (Headquarters for Nixon), the Deauville (Hq for Reagan) or the Americana&#x2014;�Rockefeller and the New York State delegation&#x2019;s own ground&#x2014;�were lavish with interlockings, curves, vaults and runs of furnishings as intertwined as serpents in the roots of a mangrove tree. All the rivers of the very worst taste twisted down to the delta of each lobby in each grand Miami Beach hotel&#x2014;�rare was the central room which did not look like the lobby of a movie palace, imitation of late-�Renaissance imitations of Greek and Roman statues, imitations of baroque and rococo and brothel Victorian and Art Nouveau and Bauhaus with gold grapes and cornucopias welded to the modern bronze tubing of the chair, golden moldings which ran like ivy from room to room, chandeliers complex as the armature of dynamos, and curvilinear steps in the shape of amoebas and palettes, cocktail lounge bars in deep rose or maroon with spun-�sugar white tubes of plaster decor to twist around the ceiling. There was every color of iridescence, rainbows of vulgarity, aureoles of gorgeous taste, opium den of a middle-�class dollar, materialistic as meat, sweat, and the cigar. It is said that people born under Taurus and Capricorn are the most materialistic of us all. Take a sample of the residents in the census of Miami B.&#x2014;�does Taurus predominate more than one-�twelfth of its share? It must, or astrology is done, for the Republicans, Grand Old Party with a philosophy rather than a program, had chosen what must certainly be the materialistic capital of the world for their convention. Las Vegas might offer competition, but Las Vegas was materialism in the service of electricity&#x2014;�fortunes could be lost in the spark of the dice. Miami was materialism baking in the sun, then stepping back to air-�conditioned caverns where ice could nestle in the fur. It was the first of a hundred curiosities&#x2014;�that in a year when the Republic hovered on the edge of revolution, nihilism, and lines of police on file to the horizon, visions of future Vietnams in our own cities upon us, the party of conservatism and principle, of corporate wealth and personal frugality, the party of cleanliness, hygiene, and balanced budget, should have set itself down on a sultan&#x2019;s strip.<br><br>That was the first of a hundred curiosities, but there were mysteries as well. The reporter had moved through the convention quietly, as anonymously as possible, wan, depressed, troubled. Something profoundly unclassifiable was going on among the Republicans and he did not know if it was conceivably good or a concealment of something bad&#x2014;�which was the first time a major social phenomenon like a convention had confused him so. He had covered others. The Democratic Convention in 1960 in Los Angeles which nominated John F. Kennedy, and the Republican in San Francisco in 1964 which installed Barry Goldwater, had encouraged some of his very best writing. He had felt a gift for comprehending those conventions. But the Republican assembly in Miami Beach in 1968 was a different affair&#x2014;�one could not tell if nothing much was going on, or to the contrary, nothing much was going on near the surface but everything was shifting down below. So dialogue with other journalists merely depressed him&#x2014;�the complaints were unanimous that this was the dullest convention anyone could remember. Complaints took his mind away from the slow brooding infusion he desired in the enigmas of conservatism and/or Republicanism, and any hope of perspective on the problem beyond. The country was in a throe, a species of eschatological heave. The novelist John Updike was not necessarily one of his favorite authors, but after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, it was Updike who had made the remark that God might have withdrawn His blessing from America. It was a thought which could not be forgotten for it gave insight to the perspectives of the Devil and his political pincers: Left-�wing demons, white and Black, working to inflame the conservative heart of America, while Right-�wing devils exacerbated Blacks and drove the mind of the New Left and liberal middle class into prides of hopeless position. And the country roaring like a bull in its wounds, coughing like a sick lung in the smog, turning over in sleep at the sound of motorcycles, shivering at its need for new phalanxes of order. Where were the new phalanxes one could trust? The reporter had seen the faces of too many police to balm his dreams with the sleep they promised. Even the drinks tasted bad in Miami in the fever and the chill.<br><br>2<br><br>His first afternoon in Miami Beach was spent by the reporter in Convention Hall. He stepped up on the speaker&#x2019;s podium to see how it might feel, nosed into the jerrybuilt back room back of the podium where speakers would wait, and Press be excluded, once the convention was begun. A room unmatched for dreariness. Dull green daybeds and sofas, a nondescript powder-�blue rug, open studding and therefore open wall-�board color, brown and tan leatherette chairs, a dreary cloth throw on a table. Every quiet color clashed with every other quiet color&#x2014;�it was the sort of room which could have served for the bridge players in an old folks&#x2019; summer camp in some flat and inland state. In this room, while preparing to orate, would wait some of the more ambitious men in America, and some of the more famous; looking at their manuscripts might be John Wayne, Barry Goldwater, John Lindsay, Thomas E. Dewey, Ronald Reagan, Governor Rockefeller, George Romney, Richard Nixon himself&#x2014;�not to mention Billy Graham&#x2014;�they would pass through the splendors of this profoundly American anteroom. Examination completed, the reporter abruptly decided he would actually go out to the airport to greet the arrival of a baby elephant which was arriving on a Delta cargo plane as a gift to Richard Nixon from the people of Anaheim, California. That seemed an appropriate way to open coverage of the convention.<br><br>3<br><br>Unless one knows him well, or has done a sizable work of preparation, it is next to useless to interview a politician. He has a mind which is accustomed to political questions. By the time he decides to run for President, he may have answered a million. Or at least this is true if he has been in politics for twenty years and has replied to an average of one hundred-�fifty such queries a day, no uncharacteristic amount. To surprise a skillful politician with a question is then approximately equal in difficulty to hitting a professional boxer with a barroom hook. One cannot therefore tell a great deal from interviews with a candidate. His teeth are bound to be white, his manner mild and pleasant, his presence attractive, and his ability to slide off the question and return with an answer is as implicit in the work of his jaws as the ability to bite a piece of meat. Interviewing a candidate is about as intimate as catching him on television. Therefore it is sometimes easier to pick up the truth of his campaign by studying the outriggers of his activity. Therefore the reporter went to cover the elephant.<br><br>It was, as expected, a modest story in a quiet corner of International Airport in Miami. Not more than ten reporters and a dozen photographers showed up. And a band, and a quorum of Nixonettes wearing blue dresses and white straw hats with a legend nixon&#x2019;s the one. A publicity puff was handed around which informed the Press that the beast was named Ana (for Anaheim, California) and was 52" high, 2� years old, weighed 1,266 lbs. and had been given to Nixon by the happy citizens of the town&#x2014;�Ana!<br><br>Ana came in on a Lockheed 100, a hippo of a four-�motor plane with four-�bladed propellers. The cargo door was in the rear, and as the musicians, Don Goldie and his Dixieland Band, white musicians from the Hilton-�Miami&#x2014;�accordion, tuba, trombone, snares, clarinet, banjo, and trumpet&#x2014;�began to play, and the six Nixonettes began to strut (they looked to be high school juniors) and the plane to unload, so the black cloud on the horizon moved over, and began its drop, black tropical rain so intense even photographers had to take shelter, and a dozen, then another dozen of musicians, Nixonettes, cameramen, photographers, and animal handlers piled into a small 6 x 8 Hertz trailer later to be used for the elephant. In the steam of the interior, the day took on surreal and elegant proportions&#x2014;�two dozen amateurs and professionals on call for one baby elephant (said to be arriving in her tutu) were equal across the board to the logic of one political convention; by the time the rain stopped five minutes later and the elephant crate was unloaded, hoisted on a fork lift off the carrier, brought near the trailer and opened, everyone gave a cheer to Ana who came out nervously from her crate, but with a definite sense of style. She took a quick look at the still photographers surrounding her, and the larger movie cameras to which certain humans were obviously connected, stepped on the still-�wet steaming runway, threw a droll red-�eye at her handler, dropped a small turd to X the spot of her liberation from the crate (and as a marker in case she wanted later to retrace her steps) then did a good Republican handstand, trunk curved as graciously as a pinkie off a teacup. To which the media corps responded with approval, Nixonettes squealing, Don Goldie Band playing Dixieland, still cameras clicking, movie cameras ticking within the gears of their clockwork, Dade County police grinning as they stood to one side (four men&#x2014;�all armed). Then Ana from Anaheim walked on her hind legs. To much approval. She curtsied, bowed, turned in a circle, obviously pleased with herself, then stretched out her trunk in the general area of everybody&#x2019;s midsection. &#x201c;Hey, chum, watch your peanuts,&#x201d; a man called out.</p><h2>You Can&#39;t Steal Second With Your Foot on First: Choosing to Become Independent in a Job-Dependent World</h2><p>This book is great for anyone thinking about starting their own business.

Not only is it a significant contribution to Hemingway critical biography, but it should rank as one of the best nonfiction books of the year."&#x2015;<em>Los Angeles Times</em></strong></p> Michael Reynolds recreates the milieu that forged one of America's greatest and most influential writers. He reveals the fraught foundations of Hemingway's persona: his father's self-destructive battle with depression and his mother's fierce independence and spiritualism. He brings Hemingway through World War I, where he was frustrated by being too far away from the action and glory, despite his being wounded and nursed to health by Agnes Von Kurowsky&#x2015;the older woman with whom he fell terribly in love.</p><p>In this, the first volume in Michael Reynolds's five-volume biography of Ernest Hemingway, he freely mimics Papa's writing style; pastiches such as the following can test even the most persevering reader's limits:<p> </p><blockquote>There had been things to prove to himself. Now they were done. There had been a job to do in Toronto. Now that was done. He had done the job. He had made his own way. His stories had sold to the Toronto <i>Star</i>. Not the stories of Italy, but newspaper stories. The real stories all came back to him. That did not matter. He had settled the question of who he was. He was a writer. When people asked, that is what he told them. If he stuck to his story, it would become true. Now he was almost home at the lake and it was summer. He was there, in the good place. He was still free. He would try not to let anything spoil the summer.</blockquote><p> The biographical narrative itself deals chiefly with three years of Hemingway's life, from his return home in 1919 from the First World War to his departure for Paris with his first wife, Hadley, in 1921. Along the way, Reynolds uses Hemingway's conflicts with his parents over his future as an opportunity to probe into the family's past, providing rich detail on his father's depressive condition and his mother's struggle for independence. Reynolds also provides plenty of background on Hemingway's boyhood home of Oak Park, Illinois (although a brief prologue that concerns itself chiefly with the town's politics and mores is made somewhat superfluous by re-addressing the same subjects in the main narrative). While <i>The Young Hemingway</i> is not the best of Reynolds's undertakings from a stylistic standpoint, and probably not the most interesting period of its subject's life, Reynolds establishes a standard for detail--and restrained psychological interpretation--that is kept up throughout the series. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Michael Reynolds was a professor of English at North Carolina State University and a finalist for the National Book Award for Young Hemingway.

They don&#39;t accept Jesus as their Personal Lord and Savior. They worship Mary and statues. They think their &#34;good works&#34; will get them a ticket to Heaven. They believe that a priest, a MAN can forgive sins. They certainly don&#39;t follow the Bible. They wrongly believe in Baptizing infants and praying for the dead. Scripture even refers to the Catholic Church as the &#34;Whore of Babylon&#34;. The Catholic Church is nothing but a haven for child predators.&#34; Archbishop Fulton Sheen once said &#34;There are not a hundred people in the United States who hate the Roman Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they wrongly believe to be the Catholic Church.&#34; Those incorrect beliefs are the focus of this book. Written in easy to understand language, this humorous study of the Catholic Faith uses Scripture, historical fact and the writings of the Early Church Fathers to show what the Catholic Church really is- the one true Church founded by Christ over 2,000 years ago. This work includes an examination of The Bible, The Church, The Sacraments, The Blessed Virgin, Papal Infallibility, Purgatory, Salvation, the Priest abuse scandal and much more; not to mention some pretty good Cajun recipes included as lagniappe!

The ones even lovers are forbidden to share.</p><p> Acclaimed dark fantasy author Poppy Z. Brite has brought together this genre's most powerful and seductive authors in an original collection of vampiric erotica, a shameless celebration of unspeakable intimacies. It is not for everyone.</p><p> But neither is the night.</p></p><p><p>Poppy Z. Brite is the author of seven novels, three collections of short stories, and much miscellanea. Known for her horror fiction, at present she is working on a series of novels and short stories set in the New Orleans restaurant world. Her novel <strong>Liquor</strong> was recently published to general critical acclaim, and her followup novel, <strong>Prime</strong>, will be released in 2005. She lives in New Orleans with her husband Chris, a chef.</p>Like scotch or very dry martinis, these 20 servings of "vampiric erotica" may be for many a resistible acquired taste. Those who do wind up enjoying this controversial new literature that goes "deeper than horror, beyond fear, to explore our darkest, most intimate hungers" may, however, find this anthology intoxicating. In it, the beast is beautiful, a situation probed by Charles de Lint, Gene Wolfe, and less-known others. Celebrating "unspeakable intimacies," the stories explore the subversive appeal of vampirism in all its manifestations as readers meet a color-blind veterinarian mysteriously--and, without regular refills, only temporarily--restored to a world of color by a strange elixir from a prostitute's third nipple; a vampire whose dying, mortal wife has nourished him for years by allowing him to hurt her, then draw her sensations of fear and pain from her for his own sustenance; and a pair of lesbians who literally copulate the father of one to death. Not as mainstream as Ann Rice, this anthology might be most comfortable in extensive and specialized horror collections. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Essential Papers on Narcissism (Essential Papers on Psychoanalysis, 13)</h2><p><p>Narcissism has recently been the focus of debate among professionals, in large part due to the controversies surrounding the world of Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg.

The British public felt Admiral Jellicoe had failed &#x2013; a reaction rooted in a hundred years of the 'Nelson cult', a conviction that anything short of a Trafalgar-style annihilation was letting the side down. True, the German Fleet had sunk more ships and suffered fewer casualties, but the British had forced them to disengage and run for port and were still cruising off Denmark spoiling for a fight. This title recounts in detail how on an early summer's evening in 1916, the two fleets clashed head to head: the events that followed would spark a polemic that still rages today.</p><p>Highly visual guides to history&#39;s greatest conflicts, detailing the command strategies, tactics, and experiences of the opposing forces throughout each campaign, and concluding with a guide to the battlefields today.Charles London is a military writer of long-standing, with a particular interest in the Royal Navy in the Great War.
